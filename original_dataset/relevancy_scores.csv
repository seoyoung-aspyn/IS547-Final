40941026,Hydrogen Fuel Cells|Alkaline Fuel Cells|Fuel Cell Durability|Direct Methanol Fuel Cells|PEM Fuel Cells,"This paper presents the experimental results of an actively controlled fuel cell/battery hybrid power source topology that can be widely used in many applications, such as portable electronic devices, communication equipment, spacecraft power systems, and electric vehicles, in which the power demand is impulsive rather than constant. A step-down DC/DC power converter is incorporated to actively control the power flow between the fuel cell and the battery to achieve both high power and high energy densities. The results show that the hybrid power source can achieve much greater specific power and power density than the fuel cell alone. This paper first demonstrates that an actively controlled hybrid with a 35W hydrogen-fueled polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and a lithium-ion battery pack of six cells yielded a peak power of 100W, about three times as high as the fuel cell alone can supply, while causing a very limited (10%) weight increase to the whole system. After that, another hybrid source using a different battery array (eight cells) was investigated to further validate the control strategy and to show the flexibility and generality of the hybrid source design. The experimental data show that the hybrid source using an eight-cell battery supplied a peak power of 135W, about four times that of the fuel cell alone. Finally, three power sources including the fuel cell alone and the two hybrids studied were compared in terms of specific power, power density, volume, weight, etc. The design presented here can be scaled to larger or smaller power capacities for a variety of applications. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

40941027,Detonation-to-Deflagration Transition,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in the modern society, such as electric vehicle and energy storage system. The most common application scenario of LIB is in the confined space. LIBs were prone to release flammable gases (such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and hydrocarbons) under abuse conditions, and the gas accumulation deflagrated with catastrophic power especially in the confined space. The ventilation condition and cathode materials of the LIB influence the destructive power of deflagration. In this study, thermal runaway (TR) tests on the Li(Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1)O2 (NCM811) and Li(Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2)O2 (NCM622) cells with different states of charge (SOCs) were conducted in a confined box under different ventilation conditions. The location of peak pressure, gas temperature, deflagration pressure, and the effects of ventilation were analyzed. Based on the measured values of the pressure at different locations, the peak pressure was generally located at the top of the confined space. The gas temperature and pressure of NCM811 batteries were generally higher than those of NCM622 batteries. NCM811 cells not only had a lower trigger temperature of thermal runaway (TR), but also a high destructive power of deflagration. The impact of ventilation condition on deflagration was studied, and the result of dimensionless analysis indicated that the deflagration pressure was influenced by opening factor, explosion gas volume, explosion heat, and explosion temperature. With the increasing of the opening angle of the window, the peak deflagration pressure firstly increased (from 30?? to 60??) then decreased, indicating that there was an competitive mechanism between the combustion and pressure relief with the improvement of ventilation condition. This work helps us understand the hazards of LIB deflagration under different ventilation conditions and provides a reference for ventilation design in battery application scenarios which ensure the process safety through fire protection design.",Characterization of the deflagration behavior of the lithium-ion battery module within a confined space under different ventilation conditions,-1,NA,NA

Indeed, the most recent works are focusing on optimizing hydrogen consumption, without taking into consideration the degradation of embedded energy sources. In order to overcome this lack of knowledge, this paper describes a new health-conscious EMS algorithm based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), which aims to minimize the battery degradation to extend its lifetime. In this proposed algorithm, the health-conscious EMS is normalized in order to address its multi-objective optimization. Then, weighting factors are assigned in the objective function to minimize the selected criteria. Compared to most EMSs based on optimization techniques, this proposed approach does not require any information about the speed profile, which allows it to be used for real-time control of FCHEV. The achieved simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the economic cost up to 50% for some speed profile, keeping the battery pack in a safe range and significantly reducing energy sources degradation. The proposed health-conscious EMS has been validated experimentally and its online operation ability clearly highlighted on a PEMFC delivery postal vehicle.",Multi-Objective Optimization-Based Health-Conscious Predictive Energy Management Strategy for Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles,1,NA,NA

40941031,Battery Management Systems,"There are an increasing number of vehicle choices available that utilize batteries and electric motors to reduce tailpipe emissions and increase fuel economy. The eventual production of electricity and hydrogen in a renewable fashion, such as using solar energy, can achieve the long-term vision of having no tailpipe environmental impact, as well as eliminating the dependence of the transportation sector on dwindling supplies of petroleum for its energy. In this report we will demonstrate the solar-powered charging of the high-voltage nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery used in the GM 2-mode hybrid system. In previous studies we have used low-voltage solar modules to produce hydrogen via the electrolysis of water and to directly charge lithium-ion battery modules. Our strategy in the present work was to boost low-voltage PV voltage to over 300 V using DC-DC converters in order to charge the high-voltage NiMH battery, and to regulate the battery charging using software to program the electronic control unit supplied with the battery pack. A protocol for high-voltage battery charging was developed, and the solar to battery charging efficiency was measured under a variety of conditions.

40941032,Battery Technology,"Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are increasingly prevalent in the transportation sector due to growing concerns about climate change, urban air pollution and oil dependence. This theoretical study reports the results of well-to-wheel (WTW) analyses for BEVs and FCEVs in different energy resource and technology pathways in China in terms of fossil energy use, total energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The energy types include coal, natural gas, renewable energy and nuclear energy resources. Special attention is given to the effects of vehicle heating loads on the WTW performances of BEVs and FCEVs. Energy use and GHG emissions reductions from BEVs and FCEVs in different pathways are examined and compared to those of gasoline-based internal engine vehicles (ICEVs). When considering the cabin heating load in vehicles, FCEVs using natural gas as the energy source outperformed all the BEVs in terms of total energy use and GHG emissions. FCEVs adopting new energy-based pathways can achieve the same WTW efficiencies as BEVs, and these efficiencies may be even higher if the hydrogen used by FCEVs is produced by the pathways of solar-solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) systems, solar-thermochemical systems or nuclear-SOEC systems.",A comparative assessment of battery and fuel cell electric vehicles using a well-to-wheel analysis,1,NA,NA

This preview highlights a novel multilayer sandwich design for solid-state electrolytes that suppresses lithium dendrite penetration and exhibits improved performance, making a critical contribution to the commercialization of solid-state batteries. All-solid-state-batteries (ASSBs) have been extensively researched for their applications in electric vehicles. Newer, safer, and better-performing solid electrolytes are considered an ideal replacement for their liquid counterparts as flammability and electrolyte leakage issues are eliminated in solid electrolytes.1Kim K.J.

Lithium metal anodes: Toward an improved understanding of coupled morphological, electrochemical, and mechanical behavior.ACS Energy Lett. 2017; 2: 664-672Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar However, the stability of batteries with lithium metal as the anode and either solid or liquid electrolytes is relatively poor. Li metal is prone to dendrite and solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on contact with most electrolytes, causing short-circuiting or overpotential ramping. Therefore, there exist significant concerns over the safety and performance of this system. This challenge prompts the broader question in the battery and electric vehicle (EV) industry, where it is essential for the chosen battery chemistry to perform safely and without failure under various external conditions and operating conditions. Recent designs by companies like QuantumScape and SolidPower have attempted to address these challenges by implementing a multilayer design approach. Currently, efforts are being made to commercialize the production of such multilayer-cell batteries. In their Nature article, Xin Li and Luhan Ye from Harvard University have designed a multilayer solid-state battery that achieves ultrahigh current densities with no lithium dendrite penetration.6Ye L. Li X. A dynamic stability design strategy for lithium metal solid state batteries.Nature. 2021; 593: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar Using a hierarchy of interface stabilities, sandwiched electrolytes, and a proposed mechanism analogous to the expansion screw effect, the authors have demonstrated superior cycling performance of the lithium metal anode. This preview highlights their novel method of sandwiching two electrolytes in a symmetric, multilayer design between graphite-protected lithium metal. Lithium was initially discharged through Li10Ge1P2S12 (LGPS), and Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 (LPSCl) electrolytes individually, and the resulting X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS) data revealed heavy decomposition of LGPS but negligible decomposition peaks of reduced S and Ge in LPSCl. These data suggest that shorting in the LPSCl battery was caused by Li dendrite formation.7Kasemchainan J. Zekoll S. Spencer Jolly D. Ning Z. Hartley G.O. Marrow J. Bruce P.G. Critical stripping current leads to dendrite formation on plating in lithium anode solid electrolyte cells.Nat. Mater. 2019; 18: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar This interesting observation propelled the authors to fabricate the novel multilayer, symmetric battery as shown in Figure 1A, using both electrolytes in sequence of Li/graphite-LPSCl-LGPS-LPSCl-graphite/Li. The cycling performance was found to be significantly superior to that of a single electrolyte system. Furthermore, it is notable that the multilayer symmetric battery cycled at an ultrahigh current density (20 mA/cm2) and lower overpotential (???????0.5V) without any significant evidence of short-circuiting. What is unusual about the use of the two electrolytes in sequence is that even though LGPS is an electrochemically less-stable solid-state electrolyte with respect to lithium metal, it is found to enhance cycling performance and obstruct lithium dendrite penetration. In parallel, the outer LPSCl layers along with the graphite layers protect the primary interface electrochemically and lower the overpotential. In contrast, a Li/graphite-LGPS-graphite/Li symmetric system cannot withstand long cycles and ultrahigh current densities. Another consequential discovery by the authors is the proposed mechanism of self-limiting decomposition in the central LGPS layer. The article draws an analogy to the functioning of an expansion screw, which is an appliance used in masonry to create holding power through expansion. Here, the Li dendrite behaves like the screw, the local decomposition front is the anchor, and the surrounding electrolyte is the wall. On cycling the symmetric battery for 300 h at 0.25 mA/cm2, a black region was observed under an optical microscope. The black region represents the local decomposition caused by lithium discharging on the LGPS layer. Upon subjecting the blackened LGPS region to further characterization procedures such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), two main observations were made that are essential to the expansion screw analogy. First, the decomposition included moderate or suppressed reduction of Ge. Second, cracks were observed in the LPSCl layer (but not in the LGPS layer). Moreover, the LGPS layered appeared masked by a ???????concrete??????? layer, which was further evidence of local decompositions occurring during cycling operation. Thus, the authors proposed that, due to kinetic stability and metastability,8Ye L. Fitzhugh W. Gil-Gonz????lez E. Wang Y. Su Y. Su H. Qiao T. Ma L. Zhou H. Hu E. Li X. et al.Toward Higher Voltage Solid-State Batteries by Metastability and Kinetic Stability Design.Adv. Energy Mater. 2020; 10: 2001569Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar such a decomposition mechanism functions as a self-healing ???????concrete mask,??????? filling submicrometer-sized cracks, both pre-existing and post-cycling ones. This is a significant conclusion drawn by the authors, which they have developed into the expansion screw analogy mentioned earlier. Finally, a sequence of LPSCl-LSPS-LPSCl electrolytes was implemented with a single-crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode. After conducting extensive cycling tests at 1.5C, the battery exhibited a 155.7 mAh/g initial capacity and excellent capacity retention of 92.8% after 1,000 cycles. The system was also cycled at 5C and 10C. The most intriguing results were published for cycling at 15C and 20C rates for 10,000 cycles (Figure 1B). At the ultrahigh rate of 20C, the shape of charge/discharge profiles varied very less, and capacity retention remained at 82% after 10,000 cycles. Since repeated cycling at high current densities promotes dendrite growth, the obtained low Coulombic inefficiency (order of 10???????3????????10???????5) and long cycling life show that no detrimental dendrite penetrations occurred in the system and prove the dendrite suppression mechanism of the multilayer design. The breakthrough work by Ye and Li at Harvard could pave the way for the multilayer solid-state design to be commercially competitive with graphite-anode-based Li-ion batteries. Although the results published in the article have answered longstanding challenges, further exploration of the proposed expansion screw effect is required to improve electrolyte design and control over electrochemical stability/instability. Additionally, the authors emphasize one of the biggest advantages of their novel multilayer design. This design strategy is compatible with various electrolytes as the central layer. The article states that a broad spectrum of solid-state electrolytes can be used, including polymers, gels, sulfides, halides, and oxides, according to the stability/instability sequence in the multilayer sandwich. Future perspectives on this aspect of solid-state battery design will address the optimization of specific power and energy. The superior performance parameters of this novel design are compared to typical lithium metal anode batteries in a Ragone plot (Figure 1C). The authors???????? unique design strategy of using a combination of electrochemical stability and instability for dynamic stabilization is what sets it apart from the conventional methods of mechanically blocking Li dendrite penetration.

This provides a unique market opportunity for developers of electric vehicles but substantial improvements in the technology are probably required if it is to be successfully exploited. There are around a dozen types of battery that are potentially relevant to road vehicles but, at the present, lead/acid and sodium-sulphur come closest to combining acceptable performance, life and cost. To develop an efficient, lightweight electric motor system requires up-to-date techniques of magnetics design, and the latest power-electronic and microprocessor control methods. Brushless machines, coupled with solid-state inverters, offer the most economical solution for mass production, even though their development costs are higher than for direct-current commutator machines. Fitted to a small car, even the highest energy-density batteries will only provide around 200 km average range before recharging. Therefore, some form of supplementary on-board power generation will probably be needed to secure widespread acceptance by the driving public. Engine-driven generators of quite low power can achieve useful increases in urban range but will fail to qualify as 'zero-emitting'.

It is also observed that EAC with an appropriate amount of In2O3 can effectively increase the overpotential of hydrogen evolution, which can not only produce the decreased hydrogen evolution rate and promote conversion of PbSO4 to Pb in capacity recovery process, but also prolong the high-rate partial-state-of-charge cycle life of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries. The battery added with 0.5% EAC and 0.02% In2O3 in negative active materials exhibits at least four times longer cycle life than that without In2O3. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

40941052,Model Predictive Control|Power Management Strategy|Battery Life Optimization|Fuel Cell Vehicles|Control Strategies,"To compete with battery electric vehicles, fuel cell (FC) hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs) are required to offer better performance in fuel economy and FC durability. To this end, this article proposes a novel real-time adaptive model predictive control (AMPC)-based energy management strategy (EMS) for FCHEVs to improve their fuel efficiency and mitigate the degradation of their onboard FC hybrid systems. First, a linear parameter-varying (LPV) prediction model of the FC hybrid system that considers the system parameter variation is developed. The model offers sufficient accuracy while enabling the real-time implementation capability of the AMPC. Then, an AMPC strategy is proposed to optimally distribute the load current of the FCHEV between the FC and the battery in real time. In each control interval of the AMPC, the LPV prediction model is updated online to adapt to the variations of the battery state of charge. The constrained optimization problem of the AMPC is then formulated to achieve a desired tradeoff among four performance metrics and is further transformed into a quadratic programming problem, which can be solved in real time. Hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed on a downscaled FC hybrid system with the proposed AMPC-based EMS, a commonly used rule-based EMS, an equivalent consumption minimization strategy, and an improved MPC-based EMS, respectively. Results show that among the four real-time EMSs, the AMPC-based EMS achieves the best performance in reducing hydrogen consumption and FC current fluctuation and the smallest optimality gap with respect to an offline dynamic programming-based optimal EMS.",Adaptive Model-Predictive-Control-Based Real-Time Energy Management of Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles,1,NA,NA

In this study, a novel nonlinear barrier conditioned super-twisting sliding mode controller (BC ST-SMC) is proposed for the control of the PEV. The conventional super-twisting sliding mode control (ST-SMC) can only cater for the disturbances with known bounds and exhibits wind-up effects in the presence of saturated inputs which deteriorates the closed-loop performance of the system. The proposed BC-ST SMC solves these problems by providing anti-windup and un-bounded disturbance rejection. Lyapunov stability criterion is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the system. The PEV comprises of two subsystems namely: bidirectional charging unit (BCU) and hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The BCU comprises of a totem pole power converter between the PEV and grid which operates in two modes of grid to vehicle (G2V) and vehicle to grid (V2G). The components of the HESS are the battery and regenerative fuel-cell (RFC) (i.e. fuel-cell (FC) with an electrolyzer). The electrolyzer generates hydrogen which is required for the FC. Fuzzy-logic based energy management system (EMS) is adopted to maintain the power balance using state of charge (SoC) of the battery and electrolyzer as inputs. Furthermore, the controller gains are tuned using multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO) using integral absolute derivative of control input (IADU) with integral square of the error (ISE) as a fitness function. The simulations are performed on MATLAB?? Simulink (2022b) which proves the superior performance of BC ST-SMC over conventional nonlinear controllers in the presence of saturated inputs.

This paper presents the analysis of a photovoltaic (PV) with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a battery storage scheme incorporated for EV CS in a stand-alone mode. In previous studies, either the hydrogen fuel of SOFC or the irradiance is controlled using artificial neural network.

40941055,Hydrogen Fuel Cells|Fuel Cell Durability|Charging Infrastructure|Battery Management Systems|Alkaline Fuel Cells,"Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), consisting of dual energy sources of fuel cell system (FCS) and lithium-ion battery system (LIBS), have become the technological frontier of electric vehicles due to the advantages of no mileage anxiety, fast hydrogen refueling, and zero emissions. However, the deterioration of battery performance at low temperatures makes it difficult to start the FCS and seriously hinders the application range of HFCVs. Herein, a sandwich self-heating structure-based LIBS is proposed to realize rapid self-heating and performance recovery of the LIBS without relying on external energy and achieve a fast cold start of the HFCV at extremely low temperatures. Furthermore, the proposed LIBS were successfully applied to all fuel cell buses in the core area of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games in batches. Firstly, compared with the mainstream heating methods, this sandwich self-heating structure has the advantages of fast heating speed (5.9 ??C/min), high heating efficiency (78.75 %), and good temperature uniformity. More importantly, this structure has a small impact on the life and energy density of the LIBS. Secondly, in response to the severe road conditions in the Winter Olympic Games area, we matched the FCS and sandwich self-heating LIBS parameters based on multi-objective optimization and realized fast cold start and rapid performance improvement of fuel cell buses. Thirdly, the sandwich self-heating structure can realize the cold start of FCS with a smaller LIBS, which provides a new possibility to reduce the cost and light weight of HFCVs.

Infrastructure for hydrogen production, transportation, and allocation is essential for FCEV promotion. For consumers, availability of few hydrogen refuelling stations is the primary concern. Currently, public charging infrastructure for battery electric vehicles, for example, fast charging station, has a more widespread coverage compared to infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling. With an electrolyser, the existing power grid can be used as an alternative to hydrogen supply and transportation infrastructure, which is still being developed. The authors propose a new conceptual combo station acting as both a hydrogen refuelling station and a fast charging station. This station can satisfy the requirement of FCEVs and battery electric vehicles, and even operate under a blackout situation. To quantify the value of coordinated operation, an optimal operation formulation of a combo station is developed. It is found that such a combo station is capable of saving land rents, reducing power network reinforcement cost, and boosting energy self-balance capability under blackout condition. 1 INTRODUCTION Hydrogen can easily be stored, and electricity is convenient for transportation. Their complementary characteristics allow for an efficient usage of highly uncertain renewable energy sources. By decoupling the production and consumption of energy, energy can be stored and need not be consumed instantly. This significantly reduces the curtailment of renewable energy generation [1]. Hydrogen has one of the highest energy density values per mass and does not emit greenhouse gases during consumption; thus, it is suitable for the transportation sector. As pointed out in [2], approximately 25% of primary energy consumption and global CO 2 emission is attributed to the transport sector, primarily road transport. Compared with the battery electric vehicle (BEV), the refuelling rate of the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is much faster, and typically, the FCEV offers better mileage. Therefore, hydrogen is considered as an alternative fuel for future road transport. The development of hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs) and FCEV cannot be carried out independently. FCEVs can obtain hydrogen conveniently after an adequate number of HRSs are available, and this will also promote the usage of FCEVs. However, at the early stage of adopting FCEVs, HRS will face the challenges of expensive hydrogen supply and low hydrogen demand because of the undeveloped infrastructure of hydrogen production and transportation; these challenges directly hinder the construction of HRSs. The results presented in [3] highlight that it is essential to build sufficient HRSs to promote the growth of FCEVs in the early stages. To address the problem of ???????chicken and egg???????? [2], the transition scheme of hydrogen production on-site was proposed. There are two common methods to produce hydrogen on-site: Water electrolysis. Many researches have been conducted on economic evaluation of on-site water electrolysis. Results presented in [4] indicate that the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) is $7.72/kg with hydrogen production capacities of 300 Nm 3 / h , considering capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX), including equipments, maintenances, labors, and land rents. The LCOH varies in a wide range because of different energy sources and equipment costs, such as ???????10.3/kg in [5], $6.24/kg in [6], and ???????5.0 /kg for alkaline electrolysis in [7]. Steam methane reforming (SMR). This method is commonly used to produce hydrogen in industry. In SMR method, natural gas is required for production of hydrogen. Therefore, natural gas rather than hydrogen will be transported into the station, and SMR is not a low-carbon method to produce hydrogen. The LCOH is $6.8/kg in Shenzhen [8], $9/kg in California [9], and $7.59/kg in Korea [4]. Although SMR usually has the advantage of low cost, it is preferable that hydrogen is produced from renewable sources. Moreover, for the areas where natural gas cannot be transported, using water electrolysis, such as PEM, can serve as an ideal alternative. As pointed out in [10], with an electrolyser, the existing power grid can be used for supplying hydrogen in all places. Because PEM-based on-site hydrogen production can be flexibly controlled, PEM-based on-site production HRSs are usually combined with uncertain wind [11, 12] or solar [13-15]. Therefore, the HRSs can use wind and solar energy to produce hydrogen, participate in power market, and provide ancillary services for power grid. An economic assessment of centralised hydrogen production and on-site hydrogen production is comprehensively studied in [16]. From the perspective of efficiency and capital expenditures, central hydrogen production and truck delivery are advantageous. However, on-site production allows small gas inventory, more compact stations, high gas purity, and carbon-free emission. PEM on-site hydrogen production is more suitable for station with hydrogen demand less than 75,000 scf/day (approximately 180 kg/day) [17]. Considering the potential of on-site water electrolysis to reduce carbon footprint, many projects have been conducted to build on-site water electrolysis HRSs. Proton OnSite [18] is a company that has on-site water electrolysis HRSs in five cities in the U.S. and Germany. There is a solar-powered on-site hydrogen production HRS in Italy [13]. Furthermore, as pointed out in [19], approximately 70% HRSs in North and South America are on-site production stations (using SMR or electrolyser); 58% in Europe and 64% in Asia. Out of the 224 HRSs globally, 65 are based on water electrolysis, of which 28 are using renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, and 35 are using grid electricity to produce hydrogen. The operation and control strategy of HRS with an electrolyser is studied in [20]. The result shows that a self-sustainable HRS that relies on renewable resources for hydrogen production, storage, and distribution is feasible. In [21], a hybrid refuelling station that can serve BEVs, FCEVs, and natural gas vehicles (NGVs) is proposed. An optimisation model considering operation constraints of different equipment is built to obtain an optimal operation. [22] considers three types of ancillary services to gain more benefits in both distributed and centralised hydrogen production. From the economic point of view, the results show that the distributed production is ideal. For a hydrogen refuelling station with a generation capacity of 100 kg, the land rents account for approximately 15????????27% of total O&M costs [23]. The current levels of utilisation of commercial chargers is below 10% [24]. The average utilisation rate of HRSs in California is 36% based on the station's hydrogen capacity [25]. An FCEV can be refilled in less than 10 min [26], and the rate of hydrogen production is high, approximately 89.9 kg/h [27]. Thus, low utilisation of FCSs and HRSs and high speed of refuelling make it possible for FCSs HRSs to share their parking spaces. Moreover, the grid connection fee for FCS and on-site HRS is high in Europe. Because the electrolysers and chargers do not operate 24/7, they can be operated coordinately to reduce peak power capacity [28]; this can save their grid connection fee. In this study, a combo station that acts as both a hydrogen refuelling and fast charging station is proposed. Its daily optimal operation models are built considering BEV charging facilities, batteries, hydrogen electrolysers, and hydrogen vessels under both normal and black-out conditions of power grid. Both operation models can be easily extended to scenario-based model c",Coordinated operation of hydrogen refuelling and fast charging combo station under normal and contingent conditions,1,NA,NA

Electrification of the transportation industry offers the advantages of increased energy efficiency and reduced local pollutants. Electric Vehicles (EVs) are environmentally friendly because they reduce fossil fuels usage even zero consumption, need fewer maintenance requirements, and lower operating costs than the vehicles powered by gasoline or diesel. However, this study focuses on comparing various energy management strategies (EMS) for a backup energy supply system for EVs. The hybrid power system (HPS) considered in this study includes DC-DC and DC-AC synchronous converters, as well as supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells. The EMS analyzed includes state machine control, classical proportional-integral control, equivalent consumption minimization, frequency decoupling, rule-based fuzzy logic, and fuzzy logic control. The HPS's efficiency, hydrogen fuel, supercapacitor or battery state of charge levels, and overall performance are evaluated as primary efficiency criteria. Additionally, the HPS not only increases system energy but also reduces the number of pack batteries required.

40941059,Redox Flow Batteries|Rechargeable Batteries,"Batteries in hybrid electric vehicle applications operate from partial state of charge and are subjected to short periods of charge and discharge with high currents. These operating conditions create two major problems, namely low charge acceptance and progressive sulfation of the negative plates. The low specific electrochemically active surface of the negative plates can be expanded significantly by adding definite types of carbon materials, which improves substantially the charge acceptance of the battery. We assume that the slowest elementary process during charging negative plates is the dissolution of the lead sulfate crystals. This process can be accelerated by adding poly-aspartic acid (Baypure DS-100 or DS) to the negative paste or to the electrolyte. DS causes partial amorphization of the PbSO 4 particles and reduces their size. Thus, the reversibility of the charge-discharge processes at the negative plates is improved and their sulfation is retarded. Besides, DS increases the overpotential of hydrogen evolution on the lead electrode. These effects of DS make it a useful additive to lead-acid batteries operated in the high-rate partial-state-of-charge duty. ?? 2012, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

40941060,Redox Flow Batteries|State of Charge Estimation,"The mechanism by which conventional lead-acid batteries (both flooded and valve-regulated designs) fail when subjected to high-rate partial-state-of- charge (HRPSoC) operation in hybrid electric vehicles is manifested as poor dynamic charge acceptance at the negative plate. This parameter is defined as the amount of charge that is actually delivered to the battery during regenerative braking phases of a driving cycle, divided by the amount of charge that could have been provided by the generator. The possible reasons for this mode of failure are discussed in terms of the processes that support the charge reaction and the competing secondary reactions that can take place at the plate during charge, namely: oxygen reduction (for valve-regulated designs), hydrogen evolution, and the accumulation of capacitive charge. To reach a full understanding of the processes associated with the unusual duty of HRPSoC operation, it is necessary: (i) to examine aspects of the charge reaction that, to date, have received little attention, e.g., local reaction within the pores of the plate active-material, effects of acid concentration on the local solubility of lead sulfate, non-uniformity of potential across the plate; (ii) to evaluate the beneficial effects to be gained from the respective use of carbon, modifications of grid design (twin tab), and the UltraBattery??? concept. ??The Electrochemical Society.",Partial State-of-Charge Duty: A Challenge but Not a Show-Stopper for Lead-Acid Batteries!,-1,NA,NA

Just as battery electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles also offer locally emission free mobility. The drive system of fuel cell electric vehicles consists of a fuel cell system, an electric motor, power electronics, a hydrogen storage system as well as a rechargeable energy storage system, typically a battery. The quantified power ratio between the fuel cell system and the rechargeable energy storage system is referred to as the degree of hybridization, although inconsistent definitions are used. As these existing definitions of the degree of hybridization of fuel cell electric vehicles don't support a distinct differentiation and characterization of the vehicles, a new definition of the degree of hybridization is proposed considering the ratio of the energy contents of the hydrogen storage system and the rechargeable energy storage system, effectively adding a second dimension. The degree of hybridization is then evaluated for existing fuel cell electric vehicles using the proposed definition and enables the characterization and clustering of the different vehicles. While this two-dimensional degree of hybridization can be used as optimization criteria during the design and optimization of fuel cell drive systems, the aforementioned clusters can be assigned to already established qualitative degree of hybridization definitions used to describe types of hybrid electric vehicles.

PHEV technology provides the potential to displace a significant portion of transportation petroleum consumption by using electricity for portions of trips. The primary energy carrier is the electricity generated from a diverse mix of domestic resources, including coal, nuclear, natural gas, wind, hydroelectric, and solar energy whereas the secondary energy carrier would be a chemical fuel stored on the vehicle such as gasoline, diesel, ethanol, or even hydrogen. The combination of fuel savings potential, consumer usage patterns, charging scenarios, battery life attributes, and battery costs have to be balanced and optimized to find the best low-cost solution for displacing fuel by using PHEV technology.

Since operating conditions such as driving patterns, number of passengers, ambient temperature, and road angle significantly affect the bus performance, these factors are considered in this study. An actual driving cycle for the Victoria City, British Columbia, Canada, is assessed, and a dynamic simulation is performed. One of the challenges in the widespread deployment of FCV and electric vehicles is fuel cell degradation and battery aging. Thus, this study deals with considering fuel cell degradation and battery aging to investigate the bus performance. Results show that in the degraded fuel cell bus, with an increase in the number of passengers from 5 to 60, the fuel consumption increases by more than 24%, which is the highest fuel consumption among the other buses. Besides, machine learning techniques are used to evaluate the impacts of the degradation phenomenon in the fuel cell stack on the hydrogen fuel cell buses fuel consumption. Moreover, battery aging on diesel-electric hybrid bus fuel consumption is analyzed at various ambient temperatures. Results illustrate that battery aging can significantly affect the battery performance by a 5.56% drop in battery pack capacity annually. Eventually, LCA analysis is carried out to evaluate each bus life cycle's total environmental effects.

40941072,Battery Technology,"The use of lead-acid batteries in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) has defined an important role for specific forms of carbon in the negative plate. With relatively low specific surface area, lead-acid negative plates cannot tolerate the high rates of charge-discharge that define HEV duty. The accumulation of lead sulfate, which invariably occurs and which is unaffected by extended charging, inspired an initial research effort on the effect of increasing the concentration of carbon black in the negative plate. Eventually, it was found that the addition of chemically pure, high surface area carbon can greatly enhance the performance of the negative plate under all forms of high-rate duty. Key to the improvement is that the carbon provides a huge surface at which charge is stored electrostatically. The carbon effectively shunts much of the initial current away from the lead-lead sulfate reaction, thereby greatly reducing the tendency to form massive deposits of lead sulfate on discharge, and reducing the likelihood of hydrogen evolution on charge.

The hydrogen supply system to the stack included a passive recirculation system based on a Ventury-type ejector. Besides, in order to achieve an optimum operation of the PEMFC stack, a discrete state machine model was considered in its control system. The inclusion of a rehabilitation operating mode prevented the stack from possible failures, increasing its lifetime. It was verified that for the rated operating point when supplying power to the vehicle (2.5 kW) the hydrogen consumption decreased, and the actual efficiency (47.9%) PEMFC was increased close to 1%.

Beyond the battery itself, the charging infrastructure is also a critical factor. Currently, EVs draw electricity from the grid, which can be integrated more easily into the existing energy framework. However, with the increase in the number of EVs, the current infrastructure may be incompatible with high-power charging. Our power generation and grid distribution systems were not designed to support the charging of such a large number of EVs. An EV charging load is almost equivalent to the electricity load of three houses (families), and an EV????????s charging time is more uncertain.6Wu D. Radhakrishnan N. Huang S. A hierarchical charging control of plug-in electric vehicles with simple flexibility model.Appl. Energy. 2019; 253: 113490Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar Thus, the increase in the number of EVs can have a major impact on the reliability of the grid, and uncontrolled EV charging may lead to grid overloads, and increments in both peak-valley load differences and power losses. Therefore, formulating smart and efficient EV charging schedules to help the power system cope with the future proliferation of electric transportation is extremely important for the future development of both EVs and power grids. Some of the key goals of planning EVs???????? charging schedules are improving driver satisfaction, reducing energy consumption, optimizing grid load, and mitigating battery degradation.7Frendo O. Gaertner N. Stuckenschmidt H. Real-Time Smart Charging Based on Precomputed Schedules.IEEE Trans. Smart Grid. 2019; 10: 6921-6932Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar Considering the potential impact of having too many EVs connected to the grid, it is necessary to limit the power of the charging facility. Another potential scenario is that more EVs might be charged in the existing charging system (thereby increasing the number of EVs connected to the system without increasing the maximum load of the system). Currently, the charging system cannot fully meet the charging demand of all the connected EVs. Thus, how can we enhance the potential of the existing infrastructure while using the limited charging capacity for more EVs? The solution, from the point of view of both the charging facilities and the EVs, is the use of intelligent charging schedules. Once such data-driven, smart charging approach for heterogeneous EV fleets aimed at solving this problem was recently reported in the journal of Energy and AI by Frendo et al.1Frendo O. Graf J. Gaertner N. Stuckenschmidt H. Data-driven smart charging for heterogeneous electric vehicle fleets.Energy and AI. 2020; 1: 100007Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar from SAP SE and the University of Mannheim. The scenario assumed in the article is that employees drive different EV models to the company office and charge them during their worktime, while the charging capacity of the infrastructure is limited. The different EV models reach and leave the charging piles at different times, with each having different initial states of charge (SoC). The proposed charging plan assigns a specific capacity to each charging pile, and it aims to maximize the total SoC of the fleet. The flow chart for this idea is presented in Figure 1. The batteries???????? charging processes follow charging profiles that express drawn current over time and are controlled by the battery management system. Constant current, constant voltage is a common charging profile. Under this profile, the battery is first charged in a constant current until the voltage reaches the preset value. Then, the battery is charged in a constant voltage, and the charging current decreases logarithmically. Generally, the charging profile reflects the relationship between the drawn current (power) and SoC of a specific EV. When batteries draw less power than the assigned charging capacity, the excessive power cannot be utilized by the EVs. Therefore, an important step in improving the efficiency of the entire facility is to match, as much as possible, the capacity of each charging pile with the drawn power of the connected EV. However, generally, the battery charging profiles are not publicly available data, and the manufacturers only provide information regarding the max power. However, a lot of capacity would be wasted if the assigned capacity were set as the max power. To develop the data-driven charging profiles of EVs, Frendo et al.1Frendo O. Graf J. Gaertner N. Stuckenschmidt H. Data-driven smart charging for heterogeneous electric vehicle fleets.Energy and AI. 2020; 1: 100007Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar collected 10,595 sets of uncontrolled charging processes for 18 EV models that fit the assumed scenario, constituting a total of 1.2 million data points. This dataset consists of the EV models, three-phase or single-phase charging information, SoC, time, and power. The regression model is built with the power as the target and all other parameters as the features. The XGBoost, a gradient boosting machine, is used as the machine learning method, and the trained model shows a good prediction performance that can represent the characteristics of the charging profiles well. The charging schedule must be adjusted in real time, based on the EVs???????? arrival and departure. When too many vehicles connect to the charging facility and the capacity allocation reaches the infrastructure limit, each EV????????s priority for future timeslots will be calculated based on the EV????????s SoC and remaining parking time. The smart charging algorithm will output the charging plan over time, which means that the capacity allocation will occur between the EVs and timeslots. The one-off regression model of the maximum drawn power prediction is applied to the capacity allocation of the smart charging algorithm to reduce capacity waste. A charging plan example is shown in Figure 1. The regression model minimizes the difference between the charging plan and the actual charging current to reduce capacity waste, especially in the constant-voltage phase. Meanwhile, the smart charging algorithm allocations make this EV????????s charging plan change in stepped variation. Based on the experimental results, it is determined that introducing the data-driven regression model into the smart charging algorithm of the limited load of infrastructure leads to up to 21% more electricity being charged to the EVs. The highlight of Frendo et al.????????s study1Frendo O. Graf J. Gaertner N. Stuckenschmidt H.

Obtaining a sufficient amount of high-quality data is generally a major challenge for most data-driven studies. Furthermore, the generalization and universality of the model directly determine the quality of the study. Fortunately, for the regression model constructed in their study, the three-phase or single-phase charging, SoC, and arrival times are the dominating factors for power prediction according to the feature importance analysis, whereas the power is barely affected by the EV model. This result proves the strong universality of this regression model.

This paper presents a new energy management system (EMS) based on a Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm for a hybrid EV charging station with a configuration that integrates Z-source converters (ZSC) into medium voltage direct current (MVDC) grids. The EMS uses the evolutionary BBO algorithm to optimize a fitness function defining the equivalent hydrogen consumption/generation. The charging station consists of a photovoltaic (PV) system, a local grid connection, two fast charging units and two energy storage systems (ESS), a battery energy storage (BES) and a complete hydrogen system with fuel cell (FC), electrolyzer (LZ) and hydrogen tank. Through the use of the BBO algorithm, the EMS manages the energy flow among the components to keep the power balance in the system, reducing the equivalent hydrogen consumption and optimizing the equivalent hydrogen generation. The EMS and the configuration of the charging station based on ZSCs are the main contributions of the paper. The behaviour of the EMS is demonstrated with three EV connected to the charging station under different conditions of sun irradiance. In addition, the proposed EMS is compared with a simpler EMS for the optimal management of ESS in hybrid configurations. The simulation results show that the proposed EMS achieves a notable improvement in the equivalent hydrogen consumption/generation with respect to the simpler EMS. Thanks to the proposed configuration, the output voltage of the components can be upgraded to MVDC, while reducing the number of power converters compared with other configurations without ZSC.","Optimal energy management system using biogeography based optimization for grid-connected MVDC microgrid with photovoltaic, hydrogen system, electric vehicles and Z-source converters",1,NA,NA

The built CS is high-efficient due to putting to practical use a proposed novel variable step-size maximum power point tracking (MPPT) scheme applied to both photovoltaic (PV) and wind parts of the CS. The main defect of a stand-alone CS is its necessity to battery banks which not only are expensive but also provide short lifetime due to a considerable number of daily charge and discharge imposed to them in a CS. This problem has been solved in this study by utilizing a FC system as supporting power source playing two roles. First, whenever PV and wind power production is less than charge demand, the FC system produces extra electric energy required. Second, whenever PV and wind power production is more than charge demand, the electrolyzer of the FC system produces hydrogen by absorbing extra electric power available in the system. Thus, the FC system acts as a high-capacity storage device in continuously regulating charging power to instant charge demand.

The electrolyte plays an obvious critical role acting as an electrochemically stable and strictly ion-conducting medium that forces electrons to flow between electrodes via an external circuit during battery charge and discharge. Very early on in its development, commercial Li-ion electrolyte chemistry settled on a narrow class of Li-salts dissolved in non-aqueous (organic) solvents (most commonly LiPF6 dissolved in a mix of ethylene and dimethyl carbonate, EC/DMC).4Blomgren G.E. J. Electrochem. Soc. 2017; 164: A5019-A5025Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar In large part due to its ability to remain electrochemically stable across a 4 V threshold (supporting the large Li chemical potential difference between anode and cathode necessary to achieve high energy density), this class of electrolytes remains the workhorse in state-of-the-art Li-ion cells. However, the highly flammable organic solvents and toxic lithium salt anion used also bring various safety and environmental concerns. Furthermore, the moisture-sensitive nature of these electrolytes also applies strict constraints on manufacturing and is responsible for the rigid form-factors of Li-ion batteries due to the requirement of a hermetic seal. In the inaugural issue of Joule, Chunsheng Wang, Kang Xu, and colleagues demonstrate a groundbreaking advance in Li-ion battery electrolytes with their design and demonstration of 4 V aqueous Li-ion batteries,5Yang C.

Although billions of Li-ion batteries have been manufactured, most of which safely operate as designed thanks to significant engineering effort and ingenuity in mitigating these concerns, infrequent but high-profile and catastrophic battery failures in recent memory continue to highlight one of the foremost challenges in battery design: safety. A water-based electrolyte is appealing from an inherent safety and potential cost angle, on the other hand. Unfortunately, above a potential difference of just 1.23 V, pure water experiences the thermodynamic driving force to decompose into hydrogen and oxygen gas, severely limiting the achievable energy density. As a useful analogy, the challenge to produce a 4 V stable aqueous electrolyte is comparable to stabilizing water in liquid form well above its boiling point. For this main reason, aqueous electrolyte chemistries have been left out of the commercial Li-ion battery mainstream, only used in low energy density nickel-metal hydride and lead acid batteries, but they remain an active area of fundamental research.6Kim H.

In their current Joule paper, Dr. Wang and Dr. Xu have now crossed the 4 V mark and managed to bridge the long-standing chasm between aqueous and non-aqueous electrolyte stability. By tapping into knowledge accumulated in the battery community over many years of non-aqueous electrolyte design, characterization, and optimization, Xu and Wang were able to borrow key concepts and successfully apply them to water. The thermodynamic electrochemical stability window of modern non-aqueous Li-ion battery electrolytes also falls short of 4 V, just not to the same extent as water-based electrolytes. Rather, the 4 V electrochemical window in modern Li-ion batteries is realized through the electrolyte????????s kinetic protection by formation of a passivating layer, which translates broadly to reducing the rate of destabilizing reactions (ideally to near zero). The most significant stability challenge resides at the battery????????s anode at low applied voltage (with respect to Li metal), which is overcome in non-aqueous batteries by the additional kinetic stability afforded by the spontaneous formation in the early charge cycles of a thin interfacial layer comprised of reduced electrolyte products. This solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)9Peled E. Golodnitsky D. Ardel G. J. Electrochem. Soc. 1997; 144: L208-L210Crossref Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 10Verma P. Maire P. Nov????k P. Electrochim.

Over the years, chemical and structural characterization of the SEI has revealed that it is truly a complex mosaic of different inorganic and polymeric organic species. Drawing inspiration from the SEI concept underpinning the operation of modern 4 V non-aqueous batteries, Dr. Wang and Dr. Xu adopted an ???????inhomogeneous SEI strategy,??????? where a strongly hydrophobic thin organic precursor coating designed for its SEI-forming ability was applied to the anode material (either graphite or Li metal) in cell assembly. Adding small amounts of preferentially reducing chemical species or ???????electrolyte additives??????? to the bulk electrolyte to ensure the formation of a better SEI layer is now common practice in non-aqueous Li-ion battery electrolyte design. However, in applying the approach to aqueous electrolytes, there is the additional difficulty of simultaneously preventing water molecules from approaching the negatively charged electrode surface before the SEI is in place and functioning. This cathodic preference for water molecules defines the ultimate challenge for a 4 V class aqueous electrolyte, as highlighted in Yang et al.????????s Figure 1 and the accompanying Figure360 (see the figure legend at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2017.08.009).5Yang C.

The production of electricity and hydrogen in a renewable fashion, such as using solar energy, can provide a clean and sustainable energy source for electric-powered vehicles. In the present work we develop a charging system to prove the concept of direct, efficient, solar-powered charging for battery-electric vehicles using solar photovoltaic-powered charging of the high-voltage nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery that is used in the GM 2-mode hybrid system. We utilize a protocol for high-voltage battery charging that was developed in an earlier study that included a DC-DC converter to boost the low-voltage produced by the PV array to the high voltage needed to charge the battery. However, no power conversion was used in the present study. Rather, we use a high-voltage solar array capable of outputting a wide range of voltages, from approximately 250 to 400 V in 50 V increments, at the photovoltaic system maximum power point. By varying the solar system output voltage we measured the solar energy to battery charging efficiency under a variety of conditions to determine the optimal photovoltaic system configuration.

Recently, the energy needs of hydrogen electric vehicles, which have developed as an alternative to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and have significant potential in the future, are met by vehicular hydrogen FCs. In this regard, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which have started to take their place in the transportation sector, can also be used as an additional energy source with their energy unit for electrical power grid-connected systems. In grid-vehicle integration, vehicular FCs can meet a significant part of the electricity consumption when parked and help stabilize the grid. In this study, multiple vehicular PEM fuel cells (PEMFCs), the most widely used in FCEVs, support the residential grid by injecting electrical power into the connecting system. For this, a multi-input dc-dc boost converter interface is designed and utilized to manage electrical energy from vehicular PEMFCs to the electrical power grid instead of a conventional single-input dc-dc boost converter. In the dc-dc converter control, Incremental-Conductance (InC) maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method is utilized to extract maximum power from PEMFCs. Subsequently, the extracted electrical energy is supplied to the grid through a full-bridge inverter controlled by hysteresis pulse width modulation. The designed grid-support system supplied by vehicular PEMFCs in the ratings of 75 kW, 100 kW, and 125 kW are connected to local dynamic loads and analyzed for a 24-h operation. The minimum load consumption value is 84.6 kWh at midnight while load consumes at most 396.2 kWh during the daytime. Various connection situations of vehicular PEMFCs are considered to examine the energy flow analysis between vehicles and the grid/consumer side. A detailed economic analysis has been carried out by using hourly energy values in terms of load profile and generated energy to show the profit amount on the user side. While the cost of the energy consumed by the loads is calculated as ???1004.8 without connection to the grid of FCEVs, the amount of profit obtained on the load side is measured as ???943.9 with the connection.",Connecting multiple vehicular PEM fuel cells to electrical power grid as alternative energy sources: A Case Study,1,NA,NA

However, few energy management strategies proposed by previous researchers can optimize the objectives at the same time. To overcome this drawback, a battery degradation-aware energy management strategy with a driving pattern severity factor feedback correction algorithm is developed to achieve the optimal trade-off between power battery degradation and vehicle economy improvement. The proposed strategy adjusts the equivalent factor according trip distance and correct the battery power to directly address the battery degradation and vehicle economy problem. First, a cost function using weighting factor to trade off the battery degradation and vehicle economy is formulated. The severity factor based on the battery aging model with effective ampere-hour throughput is used to measure the degree of battery degradation. Then, the genetic algorithm back propagation neural network for driving pattern recognition is developed. The trip distance adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy is introduced to correct the equivalent factor according to the driving pattern information and the battery degradation feedback correction strategy of the severity factor integrated with driving patterns recognition is constructed. Finally, a comparison analysis study and hardware-in-the-loop experiment are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results under Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule and Extra Urban Driving Cycle combined with the equivalent consumption minimum strategy indicate that the battery degradation feedback correction algorithm can significantly reduce the battery degradation degree while sacrificing hydrogen consumption optimization to a small extent.",Battery degradation-aware energy management strategy with driving pattern severity factor feedback correction algorithm,-1,NA,NA

Efforts to reduce these emissions focus primarily on diesel hybrids, hydrogen fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles. However, these efforts ignore the high energy intensity of producing lithium (Li)-ion batteries and the carbon fiber used in fuel-cell vehicles. Here, we conduct a life-cycle analysis to compare the impacts of the vehicle manufacturing cycle for Class 6 (pickup-and-delivery, PnD) and Class 8 (day- and sleeper-cab) trucks with diesel, electric, fuel-cell, and hybrid powertrains. We assume that all trucks were manufactured in the US in 2020 and operated over 2021-2035, and we developed a comprehensive materials inventory for all trucks. Our analysis reveals that common systems (trailer/van/box, truck body, chassis, and lift-gates) dominate the vehicle-cycle GHG emissions (64-83 % share) of diesel, hybrid, and fuel-cell powertrains. Conversely, propulsion systems (lithium-ion batteries and fuel-cell systems) contribute substantially to these emissions for electric (43-77 %) and fuel-cell powertrains (16-27 %). These vehicle-cycle contributions arise from the extensive use of steel and aluminum, the high energy/GHG intensity of producing lithium-ion batteries and carbon fiber, and the assumed battery replacement schedule for Class 8 electric trucks. A switch from the conventional diesel powertrain to alternative electric and fuel-cell powertrains causes an increase in vehicle-cycle GHG emissions (by 60-287 % and 13-29 %, respectively) but leads to substantial GHG reductions when considering the combined vehicle- and fuel-cycles (Class 6: 33-61 %, Class 8: 2-32 %), highlighting the benefits of this shift in powertrains and energy supply chain.

To maximize the economic potential of fuel cell/battery-based hybrid electric vehicles, this paper proposes a real-time cost-minimization energy management strategy to mitigate the vehicle's operating cost. Specifically, the proposed strategy is realized via model predictive control, wherein both hydrogen consumption and energy source degradations are incorporated in the multi-objective cost function. Assisted by the forecasted speed, dynamic programming is leveraged to derive the optimal power-splitting decision over each receding horizon. Thereafter, the performance discrepancy of the proposed strategy is analyzed under different affecting factors, including battery state-of-charge regulation coefficient, discrete resolution of optimization solver, speed prediction approaches and length of prediction horizon. Lastly, a comparative study is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, where the proposed strategy can respectively reduce the operating cost and prolong the fuel cell lifetime by 14.17% and 8.48% in average versus a rule-based benchmark. Moreover, the online computation time per step of the proposed strategy is averaged at 266.26 ms, less than the sampling time interval 1 s, thereby verifying its real-time practicality.",Real-time cost-minimization power-allocating strategy via model predictive control for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles,1,NA,NA
40941115,Battery Life Optimization|Power Management Strategy|Battery Technology,"The driving trip pattern is of great significance in hydrogen consumption and battery Longevity of the plug-in fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (PFCHEV). However, the traditional energy management strategy failed to consider the uncertainty of driving patterns. To overcome this drawback, a deep Q-learning network based trip pattern adaptive (DQN-TPA) battery longevity-conscious strategy is proposed in this study. To begin with, the trip pattern recognition based Learning Vector Quantization Neural Network is devised for pattern identification, and the adaptive-equivalent consumption minimizes strategy (A-ECMS) is conducted to improve the hydrogen consumption. Then, a TPA longevity-conscious strategy is developed and compared with the conventional multi-criteria (MC) optimization strategy to investigate the discrepancy brought by the pattern adaptation. And finally, in combination with the above efforts, an improved DQN-TPA based battery longevity-conscious strategy has been established accordingly. The advances are confirmed by the validation results that, the A-ECMS makes an 11.76% promotion in fuel economy by taking the deviation among different driving patterns into concern. The TPA strategy shows more adaptiveness than the MC optimization strategy in which, the effective Ah-throughput is 5.17% lower than MC-based while keeping the same economy.

40941117,PEM Fuel Cells|Power Management Strategy|Energy Storage Systems|Fuel Cell Durability|Battery Management Systems,"This paper addresses the energy management strategy (EMS) for a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV). The fuel cell system (FCS) is a multi-physics system, and consequently, its energetic performances depend on the degradation and on the operating conditions. The maximum power (MP) and the maximum efficiency (ME) points of the FCS are unique but they move with operating condition variations. Thus, developing an extremum seeking process (ESP) for both MP and ME tracking is a challenging task. In the ESP, models are identified online by using an adaptive recursive least square (ARLS) method to seek a variation in the FCS performances. Then an optimisation algorithm is used on the updated model to find the MP and the ME points. The ESP is incorporated into a hysteresis power splitting control (HPSC). A MP mode or a ME mode can be set based on the energy storage level (battery pack). The effectiveness of the proposed MP- and ME-ESP EMS is demonstrated by conducting experimental studies on two FCSs with different levels of degradation. It was demonstrated that the classical EMS based on maps are not valid when the operating parameters vary because of the level of degradation change.",Energy management strategy for a fuel cell hybrid vehicle based on maximum efficiency and maximum power identification,0,NA,NA

Project ACCEL pushed the limits of energy management, thermal management, and mass saving, while maintaining measured safety for the pilot and crew to ultimately achieve world record-breaking flights. The numerous engineering challenges involved in designing and developing the world's fastest electric aircraft have been solved by a relatively small team in a limited timeframe. The blank sheet design of the ESS and powertrain allowed for an appropriately optimised solution, swiftly moving into physical testing allowed for rapid development of the system and opportunities to iterate. In the closing stages of the project, building, assembling, and ground testing the aircraft under one roof allowed for an effective cohesive and exciting crescendo before flight operation of the aircraft at MoD Boscombe Down. 1 INTRODUCTION The aim of the ACCEL (ACCelerating the Electrification of Flight) project is to develop the technology and capability necessary to enable alternative energy storage and propulsion systems for the future advanced air mobility market rather than for the aircraft itself (Spirit of Innovation, Figure 1). [1] Previous electrification of aerospace projects include limited attempts at record breaking feats by early electric aircraft, however, the technology utilised is not transferable to what is expected of future market development. It was therefore decided that attempting to break multiple speed records over a variety of distances would best lead to the development of suitable technology for hybrid primary propulsion applications including sustained high-power demand across the entire Energy Storage System's (ESS's) capacity and fast charging for rapid energy recovery between flights. FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Spirit of Innovation in flight Prior to ACCEL, adoption of electrical technology in aviation was limited to mostly low voltage non-propulsion systems. The project intended to exploit the established automotive and motorsport High Voltage (HV) electrical methodologies and components to expedite the development process. Subsequently, validating the automotive spec HV components feasibility for the primary or hybrid propulsion systems in the aerospace sector is an output of the project to influence and guide the design of next-generation electric powertrain components. Facilitating learning on the areas of technology improvement required to facilitate the adoption of electrical energy propulsion. Through doing so, this project will also provide the United Kingdom with an independent route to electric propulsion system and component understanding for aerospace. A key focus of the project is advancing high-power battery system technology and high-power density electric machines for aerospace use. An important theme of the project is to learn quickly, testing what technologies and practices can be pulled from other sectors such as electrified automotive and motorsport while gaining an understanding of aerospace specific solutions that will need to be developed to meet performance and certification requirements for future electric flight. ACCEL follows a long tradition of using competition as a catalyst for innovation through a multitude of methods. Use of performance to drive the development and implementation of technology, specifically power/energy density and aircraft system integration. Promotion of electric aviation through the excitement of speed while meeting aerospace levels of quality and safety. Setting the world speed and time-to-climb records for an electrically powered aircraft gaining publicity and industry exposure. Attracting electrical engineers, suppliers, and Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to aviation. The project set several 'markers' Highest power electrically powered aircraft. Simultaneously highest voltage, energy, and power density aircraft battery system. Fastest electrically powered aircraft. History shows that projects of this type stimulate global interest, with investment and innovation being powerful mechanisms in accelerating electric flight to be commercially viable and thus adopted worldwide. Keep It Simple 'KISS' philosophy was employed across the entire project. This approach paid dividends such as easing the learning curve of this new technology to established aerospace stakeholders in the project while reducing the demand for extensive testing of new safety-critical hardware and software and validation in alignment with the project's drive for fast-paced development. Pilot training was essential throughout the project as this technology application is so emergent, a new understanding of the HV electrical systems needed to be firmly founded to facilitate the evaluation of the course of action in the case of an emergency. The pilot was given complete control over the aircraft's thrust and Power Distribution Unit (PDU) control, ensuring that even in a critical failure case they had total authority over the aircraft systems as opposed to an automated shutdown potentially grounding the aircraft catastrophically. Despite the obvious possible danger presented by a HV insulation failure or a cell thermal runaway, the pilot was given the best chance of reaching safety in a scenario that would typically cause a ground-based electric vehicle to automatically shut down. The drive for sustainable aviation is unlikely to be a single solution but rather a combination of different energy storage and propulsion technologies, their allocation dependent on the use case. Given the goals set for the ACCEL project, several of these alternative technologies were considered before a lithium-based ESS and axial flux electric machine based powertrain were selected. Hydrogen-based ESS fundamentally lack the power density and output stability required for sustained flight, let alone the higher demand during a climb. Additionally, the failure case of hydrogen fuel cells can result in an extremely volatile event that at the time would not have been feasible to mitigate without compromising the aircraft's take-off mass, especially within the limited timescale of the ACCEL project. Lithium-based electrochemical cells however can meet the required high-power demand, provided sufficient thermal energy rejection is implemented for sustained flight. Energy density is considerably lower for a lithium-based ESS, however, the ability to better mitigate the cell impact during a failure event is crucial to meeting the safety requirement for flight. The relative feasibility to achieve this with lithium-ion cells is far more reasonable than for hydrogen thus far. Existing electrification of aerospace Pipistrel Velis Electro is currently the only Type certified electric powered aircraft fully approved for pilot training in day visual flight rules operations. [2]. Velis Electro is a full-electric derivative of the proven Virus SW 121, it is equipped with a Pipistrel type certified electric engine E-811-268MVLC, developed with partners EMRAX and EMSISO, and Pipistrel's three-bladed composite fixed pitch propeller P-812-164-F3A. The electric machine can produce 57.6 kW, is liquid cooled, and the cooling system consists of a radiator and two pumps. Two high-power axial fans are installed behind the radiator to cool the batteries during charging. The ESS, which is crashworthy, thermal runaway inhibiting and HIRF/EMI tolerant, is formed by two high-performance batteries (Pipistrel PB345V124E-L) connected in parallel, for a total nominal energy of 24.8 kWh and a nominal bus voltage of 345 Vdc. The two-seater aircraft, intended primarily for pilot training, has a maximum take-off weight of 600 kg with a cruise speed of 90 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) requiring 35 kW. [3].

40941121,Electric Vehicles|Battery Technology|Battery Life Optimization,"Battery electric vehicles, otherwise called BEVs, are completely electric vehicles which runs on rechargeable batteries. They utilize energy which is put away in rechargeable battery packs, with no utilization of optional source, for example, gases, hydrogen energy unit, internal combustion engine, and so on. Rather than internal combustion engines (ICEs), BEVs utilize electric engines and engine controllers. During the eighteenth century, the possibility of an electric vehicle began and the advancement began. The principal successful electric car, known as The Electrobat, was created in 1894 utilizing lead batteries. Mechanical designer Henry G. Morris and scientific expert Pedro G. Salom in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania have created it. In 1895, William Morrison of Des Moines built up a six-wheeled electric vehicle (wagon) which was equipped for arriving at the speed of 23 km/h. Later on, the car organization General Motors (GM) in the mid-1960s made their first idea, The Electrovair utilizing a battery of silver and zinc which convey nearly 530 V. Decades later in 2008, Tesla Motors delivered their first battery electric vehicle (BEV), Roadster which utilized lithium-ion battery for traveling in excess of 320 km for every charge upto an extraordinary speed of 200 km/h. A portion of the renowned instances of BEVs are Chevy Bolt, Portage Focus Electric, Hyundai Ionic, Mitsubishi I-MiEV, Volkswagen e-Golf, and so forth. The Battery electric vehicle comprises of different parts which incorporate battery, charge port, DC/DC converter, electric traction motor, power electronics controller, a thermal system, traction battery pack, and so forth. Since these vehicles utilize electric engine rather than the internal combustion engine, along these lines, an enormous battery pack is expected for controlling the electric engine. For the charging of the enormous traction batteries, charging station or outlet is required, which isn't accessible all over the place and henceforth the expansion of BEVs is very troublesome. The working of the BEVs is to such an extent that the helper battery gives energy to control the frill of BEV. The vehicle has the charge port to interface with an external supply to charge the battery pack. The installed charger in it helps in changing over AC power to the DC capacity to charge the traction battery with the goal that it can store and give power to the engine. The vehicle has mounted a DC/DC converter to give a low voltage DC capacity to the components. The power from the battery pack is dealt with the electric engine which moves the wheels of the car. The torque created, and the speed of engine is controlled with the assistance of the power electronics controller, and it additionally manages the energy stream. A thermal system deals with the working temperature of the motor, and the electric transmission aids in moving the mechanical capacity to the drive wheels. This is the manner in which the vehicle moves. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) do not produce any sort of unsafe dangers, not at all like fuel-controlled vehicles or ordinary petroleum/diesel vehicles, and in this manner, they are profoundly condition cordial. Likewise, they have a low running expense of around 33% per kilometer when contrasted with regular vehicles. Considering every one of these variables, battery-worked vehicles are probably going to supplant regular ICE vehicles soon.",Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs),1,NA,NA

Currently, electric vehicles (EVs) offer a source of mobility that emphasises the use of energy storage devices to reduce CO2 emissions. The growing development of advanced data analytics and the Internet of Things has driven the implementation of the Digital Twin (DT), all to improve efficiency in the build, design and operation of the system. Regarding the components of EVs, the batteries are considered as the most expensive elements to analyse according to the State of Health and the State of Charge, which lead to implement the most optimal models, along with a DT for battery systems. The present article provides a literature review about the current development trends of EVs' energy storage technologies, with their corresponding battery systems, which gives an overview to understand different type of models and to identify future challenges in the industrial sector. Additionally, a solid explanation of the DT focussed on battery systems for EVs is discussed, highlighting some study cases, characteristics, and technological opportunities. 1 INTRODUCTION The electric market has been a point of concern in the research and development (R&D) field across the world, which has given the potential use of electric vehicles (EVs) to support climate change emissions and improve the way of living. It has been a growing trend of EVs since the last decade due to several advantages and economic benefits they offer. In 2021, Sanguesa et al. [1] conducted a study that shows the current challenges and technologies for EVs; among the most important contributions, we find the simplicity and reliability of the manufacturing maintenance, operation efficiency, accessibility, comfort, and zero emissions. It is important to mention that EVs have been classified into several categories based on propulsion technologies. According to Refs. [1-3], the five categories are listed as follows : Battery EVs: This type of vehicle works using electric power; therefore, neither an internal combustion engine nor a liquid fuel is used in the operating mechanism Plug-in-hybrid EVs: Have the characteristics of being propelled by both an electric engine charged by a pluggable external source and a conventional combustible engine. It is fundamental to specify that this category of vehicles can be connected to the grid, which contributes to the reduction of fuel consumption in regular driving scenarios. Hybrid EVs: This category of vehicles is mobilised through electric and conventional motors, the battery that provides energy to the electric motor has the mechanism of being charged due to the one generated in the vehicle's combustion engine Extended-range EVs: This vehicle is equipped with a supplementary combustion engine that enables it to charge the battery when it is needed. It is important to say that the main difference in comparison with the plug-in hybrid and hybrid EVs relies on the engine that is used for charging purposes. Consequently, it does not integrate the connection of the wheels' vehicle. Fuel Cell EVs: This vehicle is provided with a fuel cell that works through chemical reactions, using a mix of compressed hydrogen and oxygen obtained from the air. One of the most critical elements of EVs is the batteries, which are expensive components that not only affect the overall cost but also their capacity and charging time. According to Ref. [4], the most expensive element in the EV is the battery pack. Regarding the performance of the battery in EVs, there are several challenges and limitations that have been a point of interest for the scientific community, which are bulk and weight, charging time, driving range, and battery cost. In the following sections, the challenges will be analysed and discussed to familiarise the reader with the aim and focus of this research. Currently, academic and industrial R&D institutions are focussed on different issues related to EVs' storage systems, some of which are the application of modelling to understand not only physical behaviour, but also the engineering framework of the system. According to the literature review, there are different categories of battery models, which are based on the properties of the batteries, available data, physical interpretation, mechanical and thermal analysis etc. [5]. This study will focus on three main categories, which are electrochemical, electrical, and mathematical, all because of the promising applications that are applied using these models in the sustainable and renewable field. Electrochemical models are defined as the most complex and precise due to the thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena that explain the behaviour of the cell. Mass transfer, diffusion, ion distribution, and electrode theory implement time-dependent differential equations, which require high computing performance, so order-reduced methodologies and parameter model identification are considered challenging tasks to accomplish during this model implementation [5]. Mathematical models have been classified into two main categories: stochastic and empirical [6]. Empirical models describe the specific behaviour of the system using mathematical equations with certain boundary conditions and initial parameters that accomplish real-time parameter identification; however, these models have the disadvantage of achieving errors in the range of 5%????????20% [5]. Stochastic models, on the other hand, provide accurate performance and fast speed that are based on the discrete-time Markov chain. Nonetheless, a hybrid methodology is required to apply parameter identification, which in some cases increases the complexity of the model [5]. Electrical models are based on equivalent circuit analysis that recreates the operating system of the batteries; it is fundamental to point out that this category of models is faster than electrochemical models but has the drawback of neglecting high parameters in detail, such as dynamic behaviour [6]. The increasing development of EVs provides the way for new technologies that complement the application of battery models to monitor not only the physical system but also the operation process in real time; therefore, the innovative and promising DT is emerging to strengthen both sustainability and Internet of Things (IoT) fields. Since the year 2003, the concept of DT has been evolving and experiencing several definitions in the literature review, which consistently creates a lack of consistency and dilutes the concept not only for the research sector but also for industrial applications. In 2020, Jones et al. published a research paper that explains and illustrates the concept of DT [7], which is mainly defined by the CIRP Encyclopaedia of Production Engineering as follows [8]: A DT is a digital representation of an active unique product (real device, object, machine, service, or intangible asset) or unique product-service system (a system consisting of a product and a related service) that comprises its selected characteristics, prope",Overview of battery energy storage systems readiness for digital twin of electric vehicles,1,NA,NA

Energy management is one of the effective methods to increase the durability of power sources and the overall economy of the vehicle. The majority of existing studies focus only on fuel consumption. Therefore, an online applicable cost minimization strategy cooperating fuel cell and battery degradation is proposed to decrease the overall operating cost including hydrogen consumption cost and lifetime costs of fuel cell and battery. Two kinds of degradation models are both designed for fuel cell and battery respectively. Empirical degradation model and prognostic model are used to calculate the degradation cost and estimate the degradation performances of power sources along with aging. Creatively cooperating two kinds of models to precisely quantify the degradation rates of power sources under real automobile operating conditions is firstly studied. Validation under a typical driving cycle shows the effectiveness of the developed cost minimization strategy in increasing the economy of the vehicle.

40941126,Hybrid Vehicles|Electric Vehicles|Vehicle-to-Grid,"The car electrification 'pathway' can be identified in the following sequence: nonhybrid vehicles, namely, internal combustion engine (ICE) drive, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) (microhybrid, mild hybrid, full hybrid, plug-in hybrid), extended-range electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles (BEV). At least three large families of products should be considered: HEVs with ICE onboard, 'pure' electric vehicles powered by batteries recharged from outlets, and fuel cell hydrogen vehicles. The hybrid electric models continue to increase in terms of importance and presence in the market. In the past few years, they were sold in millions of units in the world and are presently relying on a generation of satisfied car drivers ready to ask for drivetrains with an increased electric component.Today, markets have opened their doors to the BEVs but, economic aspects and performance will be keys factors to declare their success. Their success cannot, in fact, prescind from aspects such as the capacity of producing low-cost batteries or recharging time, driving range and reliability. As is obvious, at the heart of their success there are drivers/buyers who, if on the one hand do not want to have polluting cars any longer are on the other hand unwilling to spend more than needed for a car of the same size and poorer performance. All this with some criticality still perceived in a very discriminating way in the choice of a vehicle, which concern recharging times and ranges guaranteed by at full charge. While the battery-powered cars have a sufficient expected range of 150-200. km per charge for urban use, recharging time is a big issue since, indeed, if a low-voltage outlet is used, at least 5-8. h are needed. Two alternative options could be the high-voltage quick charge, but it requires adequate facilities, and the quick change of the entire battery pack in dedicated service stations.In this chapter, a series of car models are presented and described, both those that are already on the market and those that are going to be commercialized shortly. The vehicles are classified taking into account the level of electrification of their drivetrain and all of them are equipped with lithium-ion batteries, the most advanced technology available today. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

40941127,Energy Storage|Charging Infrastructure|Battery Management Systems,"A grid-connected set of distributed energy resources that supply power for electric vehicle charging and hydrogen production is investigated through detailed simulation studies. This work uses a genetic algorithm to find the minimum cost for a set of distributed energy resources, the component sizes and energy management strategy are optimized simultaneously. It was found that the optimal component sizes and optimal energy management strategy have a significant influence on each other, and therefore, simultaneous optimization of the two aspects is suggested for such distributed energy resources. The presented approach yields higher time resolution in the simulation compared to previous work. Hence, the model can capture short term changes in dynamic loads and generation, making the simulated energy-management performance more representative of real conditions. The stochastically varying load from electric vehicle charging is modeled based on probabilistic data from existing charging infrastructure. With the present model, the performance of several energy management strategies can be examined. The simulation results show that using the battery storage for peak shaving minimizes the distributed energy resources overall cost while simultaneously decreasing its dependence on the utility grid.

The power provided by the hydrogen genset is used to extend the battery pack autonomy through a serial topology. This genset has the potential to be less expensive and more robust to extreme low operating temperature than a fuel cell. In addition, it can operate at different hydrogen-air mixtures. To improve the genset energy efficiency, the operating conditions that lead to a maximum efficiency need to be selected online. We propose a two-step method in which the genset efficiency behavior is represented by a parametric smooth surface in the first step whilst the operating conditions for a maximum efficiency is selected during the second step. These smooth surface parameters, identified using the recursive least square method, provided a root mean square error of the deviation between the estimated and the measured efficiency time profiles less than 2.5 ??10-3.

40941134,Solid-State Electrolytes,"The major problem of lead-acid batteries for application in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) is the progressive sulfation of the negative plates as a result of incomplete charge of the cells in the HEV mode of operation. Under these conditions, recrystallization processes take place whereby big PbSO4 crystals grow at the expense of dissolution of smaller ones. The present study has established experimentally that addition of poly-aspartic acid to the solution or to the negative paste retards significantly the growth of lead sulfate crystals. Small PbSO4 crystals are highly soluble and sustain high concentration of Pb2+ ions in the solution, thus improving the charge acceptance of the cells. It has also been established that poly-aspartic acid increases the overpotential of hydrogen evolution on the lead electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry experiments and cycling tests of cells under simulated high-rate partial-state-of-charge conditions have confirmed the above effects of poly-aspartic acid. ??The Electrochemical Society.",Lead-Carbon Electrode with Inhibitor of PbSO4 Recrystallization in Lead-Acid Batteries Operating on HRPSoC Duty,-1,NA,NA
40941135,Battery Life Optimization|Battery Management Systems,"This paper investigates the impact of two different real-time power energy management systems on the battery used in a serial topology of a Fuel Cell Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FC-PHEV): the blended mode and the charge-sustaining mode. With the blended mode, the FC contributes to the propulsion power when the power demand is high or when the battery is depleted. The charge-sustaining mode considered for this study allows the battery to be depleted in a first step. In a second step, the FC is used to maintain the battery energy within a narrow interval. Earlier designs of the two methods for FC-PHEV put emphasis on the vehicle dynamics control and the hydrogen energy saving, neglecting to consider their impacts on the battery pack efficiency. For the same rolling conditions, the simulation results with a lead-acid battery pack suggest that the charge-sustaining mode has the potential to improve the battery pack average efficiency compared to the blended mode. However, the charge-sustaining mode may require more hydrogen to achieve this improvement than what is needed when the blended mode is used. ?? 2013 IEEE.",Impacts of blended mode and charge-sustaining mode on the battery efficiency for a serial FC-PHEV,-1,NA,NA

40941139,Battery Management Systems|Battery Technology|small satellite|Lithium-Ion Batteries|Rechargeable Batteries,"Commercial and military satellites rely on high performance battery systems to supplement power provided by solar panels. Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries have a higher power density and can operate at a higher state of charge (SOC) than the Nickel Hydrogen (NiH2) batteries commonly used on communications satellites. The higher energy density and SOC of Li-Ion allows designers to utilize a smaller and lighter battery for a given space mission requirement. This reduces the launch mass and volume of the satellite electrical power system (EPS), allowing more to be allocated to payload. Li-Ion batteries require specialized management, monitoring and control to maintain the safe operation of the power system with mission critical reliability in space flight. Improper charging, balancing or discharge can cause a battery to operate unsafely. It can permanently degrade battery cell performance, or in the worst case, cause catastrophic cell failure. With proper cell charging and balancing, a high state of charge (SOC) can be maintained, and longer battery life achieved. This paper describes an autonomous, active Li-Ion battery cell balancing methodology for GEO (geosynchronous orbit) and LEO (low earth orbit) satellites that employs innovative design and circuit features. The BEU (Battery Electronics Unit) described herein incorporates an isolated share bus architecture with resonant magnetic coupling in a synchronous, floating voltage balancing system. It also includes individual cell voltage monitoring, telemetry data, and cell bypass drivers. The authors explain the need for such balancing systems and how they interoperate with charging mechanisms currently in use on satellites today. The advantages of the active BEU balancing methods compared to the alternative passive resistor-shunt method are discussed in the context of the extreme environments and conditions of a GEO/LEO space vehicle.

However, the traditional energy management strategy ignores the lifetime of the battery for good fuel economy. To overcome this drawback, a battery longevity-conscious energy management predictive control strategy is proposed based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm predictive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (DRL-PECMS) in this study. To begin with, the back-propagation neural network is devised for predicting demand power, and the predictive equivalent consumption minimum strategy (PECMS) is proposed to improve the hydrogen consumption. Then, in order to improve the battery durability performance, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to optimize the battery power and improve battery lifetime. Finally, numerical verification and hard-ware in the loop experiments are conducted to validate hydrogen consumption and battery durability performance of the proposed strategy. The validation results show that, compared with CD/CS and SQP(Sequential Quadratic Programming), the PECMS combined can achieve better fuel economy with the fuel consumption reduction by 55.6 % and 5.27 %, which effectively improves the fuel economy.

40941141,PV System|Photovoltaic Arrays|Solar Energy,"The production of electricity and hydrogen in a renewable fashion, such as using solar energy, can provide a clean and sustainable energy source for electric-powered vehicles, including fuel-cell and battery-electric vehicles. Our research on generating hydrogen and charging batteries using renewable solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity has led to the development of a simple and convenient new metric called the coupling factor that describes the fraction of the maximum PV power transferred to electrical loads. The keystone of the coupling factor concept is a regression model to calculate the maximum PV voltage, current, and power as a function of the instantaneous incident solar irradiance and the photovoltaic module temperature. The coupling factor can range from zero to one, i.e., no transfer of power from the PV system to the load, to complete transfer of the PV power. We describe the derivation of regression models to compute important PV electrical output variables, such as the open circuit voltage, the short circuit current, the maximum power point voltage, the maximum power point current, and the coupling factor as a function of the fundamental measured variables affecting those quantities. The models are derived for PV modules used in our previous research to power an electrolyzer and charge high-voltage batteries. In addition, we develop models for other modules using PV cell technologies different from those used in our PV system. Some of the calculated quantities are compared to measurements for our PV system. The usefulness of these quantities, and especially the coupling factor, in rating the transfer of PV power to electrolyzer and battery loads, is illustrated.

40941154,Life Cycle Assessment,"Light-duty vehicles contribute considerably to global greenhouse gas emissions. Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) may play a key role in mitigating these emissions without facing the same limitations in range and refueling time as battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In this study, we assess the environmental impacts and costs of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system (FCS) for use in light-duty FCVs and integrate these results into a comparative evaluation between FCVs, BEVs, and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). We conduct a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost assessment for the current state of the technology and two future scenarios for technological development. We compile a detailed and consistent inventory for the FCS by systematically disassembling and integrating information found in cost studies. For the vehicle-level comparison, we use models to ensure that vehicle size, performance, and fuel consumption are unbiased between vehicle types and consistent with the scenarios for technological development. Our results show that FCVs can decrease life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 50 % compared to gasoline ICEVs if hydrogen is produced from renewable electricity, thus exhibiting similar emission levels as BEVs that are charged with the same electricity mix. If hydrogen is produced by natural gas reforming, FCVs are found to offer no greenhouse gas reductions, along with higher impacts in several other environmental impact categories. A major contributor to these impacts is the FCS, in particular the platinum in the catalyst and the carbon fiber in the hydrogen tank. The large amount of carbon fiber used in the tank was also the reason why we found that FCVs may not become fully cost competitive with ICEVs or BEVs, even when substantial technological development and mass production of all components is assumed. We conclude that FCVs only lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions than ICEVs if their fuel is sourced from renewable energy, as is the case with BEVs. FCVs are an attractive alternative to ICEVs in terms of vehicle performance criteria such as range and refueling time. However, the technological challenges associated with reducing other environmental impacts and costs of FCVs seem to be as large, if not larger, than those associated with the capacity and costs of batteries for BEVs????????even when not taking into account the efforts required to build a hydrogen infrastructure network for road transportation.",Integrated environmental and economic assessment of current and future fuel cell vehicles,1,NA,NA

However, the energetic characteristics of the electrochemical devices (fuel cell, battery, and supercapacitor) are time-varying due to the influence of ageing, and different ambient and operating conditions.

The rationale behind this solution is to use the exothermic absorption and endothermic desorption processes of hydrogen in metal hydrides for heating and cooling the battery pack, respectively, thus ensuring an optimal thermal management control. An experimental investigation is carried out on a prototype in order to proof the concept and preliminary assess its feasibility for actual implementations. The results show that the system is capable to effectively control the temperature variations within the battery pack: for 1C and 1.5C constant-current discharge tests, a desorption of 30%???40% of hydrogen, over the total amount stored into the metal hydride tank of the system, allows the final average temperature of the battery pack to be around 15 ??C lower than the one reached without thermal management. Moreover, it is found that the system is potentially capable of providing a suitable thermal management for more than four hours under realistic driving conditions. The proposed energy storage system also achieves inherently high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities, with theoretical values equal to 182 Wh/kg and 530 Wh/L, respectively. These estimates represent reference values for further design improvements.",Innovative battery thermal management system based on hydrogen storage in metal hydrides for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles,1,NA,NA

Based on a commercially available gasoline genset, this hydrogen-based generator can use a mixture of gasoline and hydrogen in which the proportion of gasoline varies between 0% and 100%. This hybrid energy system is controlled by an onboard energy management system that splits the electric power demand between the battery and the genset. Given the genset power profile, a maximum efficiency tracking module was designed to provide optimal operating conditions (engine speed and electric power) to a real-time controller.

40941171,Vehicle-to-Grid|Fuel Cell Vehicles|Battery Management Systems,"In typical vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging systems, energy transfer is provided from a battery electric vehicle (BEV) to charge the energy storage unit of another BEV. In this study, the utilization of a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) as an energy provider is purposed to charge the energy storage unit of a BEV in V2V interaction. Since FCEVs are filled with hydrogen, it also eliminates the disadvantages of traditional BEV energy providers, such as a reduction in the amount of stored energy and the need for more time to charge fully. In the designed system, a new plug-in external V2V battery charger topology supported by an FCEV has been proposed to supply electrical energy. In order to control the energy transfer between electric vehicles (EVs), a sliding mode controller is adapted to manage the external converter interface located between vehicles. The designed controller shows improved robustness against the system dynamics uncertainties and disturbances generated by a variety of internal and external causes. In the designed section, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell with the maximum operational rating of 75 kW is used as an energy provider to feed consumer loads. The proposed system has been designed and analyzed for several loading situations from 20% to 100% loading and obtained performance results have been compared with a conventional controlled V2V battery charger system. The case studies validate that the proposed V2V charger system gives better results than the conventional controlled FC-supported V2V. The stability and robustness of output electrical waveforms are better for the designed system. In this context, the tracking error of the conventional controller is about 8% larger than that of the designed sliding mode control for dynamic load changes. The sliding mode controller has a faster settling time (approximately 0.12 s) in comparison with the conventional controlled V2V charger system. Also, mean absolute error values verify that the designed sliding mode controller operates smoothly under all cases except load transition compared to the typical control method.

The objective of the strategy is to minimise the cost of ownership of a low-power (15 kW) fuel cell (FC)-battery electric vehicle. Both the fuel consumption cost and power sources degradation costs are combined to represent the total cost of ownership. The simple adaptive rule-based strategy optimises the FC operation during low-traction power operation and switches to battery charge-sustaining operation for high traction power operation. This minimises fuel consumption and increases the lifetimes of the FC and of the battery. The strategy is then compared with the EMS of the 2015 Toyota Mirai, and the challenge vehicle model is modified to capture the learnings from the Mirai. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis for a plug-in FC vehicle is considered in order to improve FC lifetimes and to reduce costs for short drive cycles. 1 Introduction The objective of this paper is to develop an optimised rule-based energy management strategy (EMS) for the fuel cell vehicle (FCV) model shown in Fig. 1 which was provided in the IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (VTS) Motor Vehicles Challenge 2017 [1], while also modifying the model based on the 2015 Toyota Mirai FCV, and considering a plug-in FCV (PFCV) option. This was the first VTS challenge to develop an EMS for an FCV within a limited development time and 48 participants from 14 countries each developed an EMS. The second VTS challenge (2018) required the development of an EMS for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), while the 2019 challenge involves an EMS for a locomotive application. Fig. 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint FCV model configuration for the VTS challenge FCVs are hybrid-electric vehicles (HEV) with a fuel cell (FC) as the primary power source for the traction drive [2, 3]. The FC is a low-voltage source and requires a boost converter at the FC output to increase the dc link voltage at the input to the traction drive, thereby reducing the inverter and motor losses in the traction drive system [4]. The FC is a unidirectional power source and so requires secondary power sources, such as batteries and supercapacitors (SCAPs), to absorb regenerative braking energy [5]. The dynamic response of an FC has, until recently, been regarded as slow which has resulted in these secondary power sources providing power to the traction motor during vehicle acceleration to improve the performance of the vehicle [6-8]. An EMS controls the power-sharing between the primary and secondary power sources in the FCV. The complexity of the EMS and the controllability of each power source depend on the configuration of the power sources in the FCV. The simplest configuration, shown in Fig. 1, uses a battery or a SCAP directly connected to the boost converter output. In this configuration, battery power equates to the difference between the traction power and the FC output power. The EMS can directly control the FC power output while also indirectly controlling the battery power during steady-state operation. If the dynamic power response of the FC is limited, the EMS typically provides the average traction power requirement while minimising hydrogen (H2) fuel consumption by optimising the operating point of the FC [9]. Note that a bidirectional dc????????dc typically interfaces the battery to the dc link in high-power vehicles such as the Toyota Mirai [10]. The price premium associated with new zero-carbon emission vehicles such as an FCV can be a barrier to their adoption by consumers. Research studies show that if a total cost of ownership (COO) approach is applied to these vehicles, then the lower fuel costs [11, 12] or the higher resale values [13] can offset the purchase price premium during the initial years of ownership (typically a three-year period). Life-cycle cost analysis studies [14] are conducted over a longer time period and in these studies, the degradation of a major power source such as the battery or the FC can result in high replacement costs. These replacement costs can negate the lower fuel costs in the initial years of operation. Development of an EMS in an HEV design, using an internal combustion engine (ICE) as the primary power source, tends to focus on minimising fuel consumption but the significance of power-source replacement costs to the real operating costs of these vehicles is rarely mentioned. Given that an FC vehicle has two power sources with degradation rates higher than the ICE of a conventional vehicle, minimising the degradation rates must be a critical operating strategy for this vehicle. This leads to the concept of developing an EMS based on minimising COO costs rather than just minimising fuel consumption. The 2017 challenge scoring was based on the total COO, which comprises of the combined costs associated with H2 fuel consumption, FC degradation, battery degradation as well as a battery recharge cost to restore the battery to 100% state of charge (SOC) at the end of each drive cycle. The EMS can only control the FC output current, IFC, within a range of 0????????400 A, and the regenerative-braking distribution factor, kD within a specified range of 0????????0.5. All the costs in this paper are reported in US dollars ($) as this was the currency required in the challenge. This paper presents an optimised rule-based EMS for the challenge model which outperforms the published strategies for this challenge. The authors provide an overview of EMS development techniques and power source degradation mechanisms. The EMS of the Toyota Mirai is explored based on the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) test report [8]. The challenge vehicle model is modified to match the Mirai FC performance. Finally, a PFCV is considered as a viable option to reduce drive cycle costs and increase the FC lifetime. The paper is organised as follows; EMS development techniques, FC degradation, and battery degradation are reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 details the FCV model provided in the challenge. Section 4 describes the experimental tests and offline-optimisations to develop our EMS. Section 5 presents the Simulink model of the new simple adaptive rule-based EMS. Section 6 examines the 2015 Toyota Mirai and the modifications to the challenge FCV model. Section 7 is a cost-analysis of a PFCV configuration to reduce the total ownership costs for short drive cycles. Section 8 provides some concluding remarks. 2 EMS and power source degradation This section reviews the literature on EMS development in HEV designs and on operating conditions that impact degradation in both FC and batteries. A brief review of other studies on EMS for FCV is also included. 2.1 EMS development techniques The objective of an EMS is to specify the operating levels for each of the power sources in an HEV or FCV to minimise a particular quantity, e.g. the fuel consumption of the vehicle over a given drive cycle. The system optimisation problem is usually specified with numerous system constraints such as the dynamic operational limits of individual system components. The techniques used to solve this problem may be classified as model-based optimisation or rule-based optimisation. Model-based optimisation tends to be computationally complex and requires long computational times. Model-based techniques are difficult to implement for real-time control of power sources as they also require prior knowledge of the complete drive cycle to determine an optimum global solution. The most frequently referenced model-based optimisation techniques are Dynamic Programming (DP), Pontryagins Minimum Principle (PMP), and Equivalent Consumption Minimisation Strategies (ECMS) [15-17]. DP yields an optimised global solution for a cost function provided the time horizon of the problem is fixed and provided that simple mathematical models of the system can be formulated [18]. The optimised solution is found by defining possible system states for each time-period interval within local and global system constraints. Starting at the final system state, the costs associated with transitioning between all possible states in a time interval to all po",Fuel cell vehicle energy management strategy based on the cost of ownership,1,NA,NA
40941177,Electric Vehicles,"This paper compares battery electric vehicles (BEV) to hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) and hydrogen fuel cell plug-in hybrid vehicles (FCHEV). Qualitative comparisons of technologies and infrastructural requirements, and quantitative comparisons of the lifecycle cost of the powertrain over 100,000 mile are undertaken, accounting for capital and fuel costs. A common vehicle platform is assumed. The 2030 scenario is discussed and compared to a conventional gasoline-fuelled internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrain. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis shows that in 2030 FCEVs could achieve lifecycle cost parity with conventional gasoline vehicles. However, both the BEV and FCHEV have significantly lower lifecycle costs. In the 2030 scenario, powertrain lifecycle costs of FCEVs range from $7360 to $22,580, whereas those for BEVs range from $6460 to $11,420 and FCHEVs, from $4310 to $12,540. All vehicle platforms exhibit significant cost sensitivity to powertrain capital cost. The BEV and FCHEV are relatively insensitive to electricity costs but the FCHEV and FCV are sensitive to hydrogen cost. The BEV and FCHEV are reasonably similar in lifecycle cost and one may offer an advantage over the other depending on driving patterns. A key conclusion is that the best path for future development of FCEVs is the FCHEV.","Comparative analysis of battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell and hybrid vehicles in a future sustainable road transport system",1,NA,NA
40941178,Electric Drives,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (composed of automakers Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler) announced in January 2002 a new cooperative research effort. Known as FreedomCAR (derived from ''Freedom'' and ''Cooperative Automotive Research''), it represents DOE's commitment to developing public-private partnerships to fund high risk, high payoff research into advanced automotive technologies. Efficient fuel cell technology, which uses hydrogen to power automobiles without air pollution, is a very promising pathway to achieve the ultimate vision. The new partnership replaces and builds upon the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles initiative that ran from 1993 through 2001. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL's) Advanced Power Electronics and Electric Machines (APEEM) subprogram within the DOE Vehicle Technologies Program (VTP) provides support and guidance for many cutting-edge automotive technologies now under development. Research is focused on developing revolutionary new power electronics (PE) and electric motor technologies that will leapfrog current on-the-road technologies. The research and development (R&D) is also aimed at achieving a greater understanding of and improvements in the way the various new components of tomorrow's automobiles will function as a unified system to improve fuel efficiency. In supporting the development of advanced vehicle propulsion systems, the APEEM subprogram has enabled the development of technologies that will significantly improve efficiency, costs, and fuel economy. The APEEM subprogram supports the efforts of the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership through a three phase approach intended to: (1) identify overall propulsion and vehicle related needs by analyzing programmatic goals and reviewing industry's recommendations and requirements and then develop the appropriate technical targets for systems, subsystems, and component research and development activities; (2) develop and validate individual subsystems and components, including electric motors and PE; and (3) determine how well the components and subsystems work together in a vehicle environment or as a complete propulsion system and whether the efficiency and performance targets at the vehicle level have been achieved. The research performed under this subprogram will help remove technical and cost barriers to enable the development of technology for use in such advanced vehicles as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles, and fuel-cell-powered automobiles that meet the goals of the VTP. A key element in making these advanced vehicles practical is providing an affordable electric traction drive system. This will require attaining weight, volume, and cost targets for the PE and electrical machines subsystems of the traction drive system. Areas of development include: (1) novel traction motor designs that result in increased power density and lower cost; (2) inverter technologies involving new topologies to achieve higher efficiency, with the ability to accommodate higher temperature environments while achieving high reliability; (3) converter concepts that use methods of reducing the component count and integrating functionality to decrease size, weight, and cost; (4) new onboard battery charging concepts that result in decreased cost and size; (5) more effective thermal control through innovative packaging technologies; and (6) integrated motor/inverter concepts. ORNL's Power Electronics and Electric Machines Research Program conducts fundamental research, evaluates hardware, and assists in the technical direction of the VTP APEEM subprogram. In this role, ORNL serves on the FreedomCAR Electrical and Electronics Technical Team, evaluates proposals for DOE, and lends its technological expertise to the direction of projects and evaluation of developing technologies. ORNL also executes specific projects for DOE. The following report discusses those projects carried out in FY 2010 and conveys highlights of their accomplishments.

40941182,Battery Life Optimization,"Battery electric vehicles (EV) present a particular challenge to the development of more efficient and effective heating and cooling systems for automotive applications. Because heating-ventilating-air conditioning (HVAC) systems are electrically powered, vehicle range is reduced when the HVAC system is operating. Consequently, it is necessary to devise new approaches which significantly reduce the HVAC energy requirements. Specifically, the summertime interior heat load must be reduced by limiting infrared (IR) energy transmission into the passenger compartment, and, heat pump coefficient of performance (COP) needs substantial improvement. Furthermore, wintertime heating and defrosting requirements may consume half the electrical energy stored in the battery if based on electrical heaters. The scope of this paper is limited to identifying and evaluating the alternative solutions to HVAC battery electric vehicles. These include: basis for determining HVAC boundary design assumptions and showing mathematical methods for estimating the HVAC load and energy requirements; evaluation of the new European and Japanese approaches to wintertime heating, such as: NaS battery, motor and component waste heat recovery, electric seat warmer, radiant foot warmer, electric windshield and backlight defrost, molten salt latent heat storage, metal hydride hydrogen storage and catalytic heater, and, liquid fueled heater. ?? 1993 IEEE",Heating and cooling battery electric vehicles-the final barrier,-1,NA,NA

40941186,PEM Fuel Cells|Fuel Cell Durability|Battery Life Optimization|Power Management Strategy|Hydrogen Fuel Cells,"In recent years, the fuel cell electric vehicles have been attracting attentions for their zero emission of greenhouse gases. In the vehicle applications the most promising fuel cell is the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell because of its relatively small size, lightweight nature, and low reaction temperature. However, a pure fuel cell vehicle has several disadvantages. Therefore the fuel cell systems are always combined with other energy storage systems such as batteries and supercapacitors. This paper proposes a rule-based energy management strategy based on power prediction of the lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor. The case conditions of different operation modes have been discussed. The hydrogen consumptions of 10%, 30%, and 50% state-of-charge (SOC) thresholds are 1.154 kg, 1.273 kg and 1.382 kg.

40941187,Fuel Cell Vehicles,"The transition to fossil-free transport is an unavoidable challenge that is ahead of us in the Czech transport sector in the not-too-distant future. The most promising alternatives to fossil fuels, currently under serial production, are battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles. This article introduces a concept of plug-in fuel cell electric vehicle which combines the advantages of the two, optimized for use in the Czech Republic. The assessment is driven by the criteria of powertrain component dimensioning, non-exhaust emissions and operational economy. The total weight of the powertrain and the derived emission footprint of the concept vehicle is calculated based on state-of-the-art battery, fuel cell and hydrogen storage technologies. The concept is then compared to other alternative powertrains in terms of the operational economy, based on energy and fuel costs in the Czech Republic in May 2023. We demonstrate that the plug-in fuel cell electric vehicle can cover the overwhelming majority of driving routes of Czech drivers using the highly efficient battery electric propulsion, while the rest can be serviced using the fast-refuelling fuel cell electric powertrain. In addition, the concept vehicle can be significantly lighter than an equivalent battery electric vehicle, which leads to a considerable reduction of non-exhaust emissions. As far as the operational economy is concerned, we determine that the operating costs of the concept vehicle are equal to those of the battery electric vehicle for shorter routes and lower than those of the fuel cell vehicle for longer routes. We therefore conclude that the plug-in fuel cell electric vehicle can be a viable alternative to the current clean transport technologies as it combines the benefits of the two most popular fossil-free alternative transport powertrains in the Czech Republic while striking a good balance between energy efficiency, non-exhaust emission reduction, driver convenience and operating costs.",Plug-in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Concept in Relation to Driving Practices in the Czech Republic,1,NA,NA

Indeed, the high cost of battery energy storage, the limited EV autonomy and battery lifespan, the battery charging time, the deployment cost of a fast charging infrastructure, and the significant impact on the power grid are the origin of several research projects focused on advanced power electronics topologies and the optimization of the EV charging stations in terms of power transfer and geographical location. Three charging levels can be distinguished, which differ in terms of output power and charging time. The higher the level of charging, the faster the charging process, as more power is delivered to the vehicle at the expense of power quality issues and disturbances. Moreover, three types of charging systems can be distinguished, which are inductive recharging (contactless power transfer), conductive charging systems, and battery swapping. Additionally, EVs encompass fuel cell (FC) EVs, which uses hydrogen as primary energy resources, which is nowadays under extensive research activities in academia and industry.

40941191,Fuel Cell Durability|PEM Fuel Cells,"In a multi-stack fuel cell (FC) hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), the power sources (battery and FC) have different energetic characteristics. Hence, efficient power distribution for such a multi-source system is a critical issue. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been recently introduced as a potential tool for energy management strategy (EMS) design in FC-HEVs. However, the desirable performance of RL is concerned with the definition of a suitable performance criterion, known as reward function, based on which the agents out to take actions in an environment. Hence, the definition of a suitable reward function is of great importance. Maximizing the performance and lifespan of the energy sources whilst minimizing the fuel consumption are typical examples of the operational criteria in a FC-HEV. These conflicting criteria normally try to quantify the trade-offs in satisfying different objectives or to find a single solution that satisfies the subjective preferences. This study aims at comparing the performance of an RL-based EMS in a multi-stack FC-HEV, composed of two FCs and a battery pack, using two different reward functions. The utilized reward functions are based on hydrogen and degradation minimization, and efficiency enhancement.

In this work, a novel model predictive control-based energy management is developed for a fuel cell based light-duty range-extended hybrid electric vehicle. To fulfill the model predictive control framework, a cooperative speed forecasting method based on Markov Chain and fuzzy C-means clustering technique is proposed, which contains multiple predictive sub-models for handling different driving patterns. The final prediction results are obtained by synthesizing the forecasted speed profiles from all sub-models with the quantified fuzzy membership degrees. Besides, an adaptive battery State-of-Charge reference generator is built, which can regulate the SoC depleting rates against various power requirements. Combined with the forecasted speed and SoC reference, the desirable control actions are derived through minimizing the performance index over each finite time horizon. As a result, under the realistic urban-based postal-delivery mission profiles, the proposed strategy can achieve over 3.79% equivalent hydrogen consumption saving and over 40.04% fuel cell power dynamics decrement against benchmark strategy.

Within the road transport sector, electric vehicles with a hybrid powertrain, including battery packs and hydrogen Fuel Cells (FCs), are gaining importance owing to their adaptability to a wide variety of applications, high driving mileages and short refueling times. The control strategy is crucial to achieve a proper management of the energy flows, to maximize energy efficiency and maximize components durability and state of health. This work is focused on the design of an integrated Energy Management Strategy (EMS), whose aim is to minimize the hydrogen consumption, by operating the FC mainly in the high efficiency region while the battery pack works according to a charge sustaining mode. The proposed EMS is composed of a control algorithm and a supervisor. A series of fuzzy controllers have been implemented: their Membership Functions have been designed by starting from a first guess and subsequently they have been trained through a Genetic Algorithm, targeting the optimal results previously obtained by a Dynamic Programming approach on specific driving cycles, resulting from a k-means clustering algorithm. On the other hand, within the supervisor, a Driving Pattern Recognition algorithm has been implemented, able to detect in real-time the actual driving conditions and to switch adaptively between the proper sub-optimized fuzzy controller options. The analysis has been performed for a microcar application, with four 2kW-nominal in-wheel motors, two 2kW rated power FCs and a 5.1kWh-capacity battery pack.

In this paper, the energymanagement control problem for a series plug-in PEMFC/Li-ion battery hybrid midsize sedan is formulated and investigated using a two-stage controller (TSC). The control objective is to minimize hydrogen consumption and simultaneously protect PEMFC health. The proposed TSC consists of two controllers designed in two stages with different control functions. During the first design stage, a predictive controller is developed using the telemetry equivalent consumption minimization strategy (T-ECMS) approach to predict the global battery state-of-charge (SOC) optimality trend and local control reference, without regard for the PEMFC health constraints. During the second stage of design, a tracking controller is designed to track the local control reference with respect to the PEMFC health constraints and other physical limitations at the current control step, which ensures that the system follows the optimal battery SOC reference over a long time horizon. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed TSC is compared with the T-ECMS and an electric vehicle controller (EVC) under the Matlab/Simulink software environment.

40941200,Battery Life Optimization|Power Management Strategy|Battery Management Systems|Control Strategies,"This paper proposes three online real-time energy management strategies for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles aimed at minimizing the total running cost over the vehicle's lifecycle. The cost comprises hydrogen consumption, battery electricity consumption, and the degradation of fuel cell and battery systems. The first strategy is a rule-based approach that controls fuel cell power at several fixed levels, with the battery state-of-charge serving as the shifting condition between these levels. The second strategy is an optimization-based approach that determines the fuel cell power by minimizing the instantaneous running cost. Two coefficients, dependent on the battery state-of-charge, are employed to adjust the cost weights of hydrogen consumption, battery electricity consumption, and fuel cell system degradation. The third strategy combines rules with optimization, incorporating the rules as constraints into the cost optimization model. To account for practical driving conditions throughout the vehicle's lifecycle, short distance driving cycles, long distance driving cycles, and commuter driving cycles are separately investigated. The rule and optimization combined energy management strategy outperforms the others in all driving conditions, benefiting from fewer fuel cell system start-stop cycles and increased opportunities for operating in high-efficiency regions.",Rule and optimization combined real-time energy management strategy for minimizing cost of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles,1,NA,NA

This study presents a novel solution using neural fuzzy network control in a high-gain DC-DC boost converter to address these issues.

However, the higher cost and short life of the PEMFC system and battery in an electric vehicle prohibit the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) from becoming the mainstream transportation solution.

40941206,Sustainability,"The Earth is moving toward a tipping point in terms of global warming, with atmospheric CO2 trapping heat which reduces light-reflective snow cover and GHG release from the arctic tundra. The effects on our planet include rising sea levels, increased precipitation, and, most obviously, rising temperatures. In this editorial we argue that it is now time the world comes together to solve the energy problem by collectively embracing the lowest cost energy solutions which, fortuitously, also happen to be green. Vested interests can no longer hide behind economic arguments as, after years of technological improvements, wind and solar are now found to be cheaper than fossil fuels in most cases for energy generation. The debate about climate change is highly politicized. Not everyone is convinced that CO2 emissions are worth curbing despite seemingly irrefutable evidence in the IPCC????????s latest report.[1] Some have vested interests in exploiting fossil fuels while others think alternative, cheaper solutions can be found. Countries that have shifted from manufacturing to service-based economies will find it easier to decarbonize. Other countries with relatively low carbon emissions per capita but large populations believe it is unfair that they should have to bear heavy costs of decarbonization to solve a problem that wealthier countries have created. Fortunately, one does not need to believe in the climate change science or altruism to solve this problem???????? economics, with a little help from advances in materials technology, will suffice. In October 2021, the International Energy Agency published its latest World Energy Outlook[2] in which is states ???????In most markets, solar PV or wind now represents the cheapest available source of new electricity generation.??????? Note the IEA, which was established during the 1970s oil crisis to provide statistics on the oil market, has been criticized in the past for ???????underplay[ing] the speed at which the world could switch to renewable sources of energy???????.[3] Hence the IEA????????s promotion of renewable energy, not on environmental grounds but simply on the basis of cost has added weight. The IEA report goes on to state that ???????the low costs of wind and solar PV mean that more than half of the additional emissions reductions could be gained at no cost to electricity consumers.??????? In some cases, it is even cheaper to build a new solar PV plant than to continue operating an existing coal or natural gas-fired plant. IRENA[4] estimates that 61% of coal capacity in the United States costs more to operate than building new renewable energy plants. Retiring these coal plants and replacing them with renewables would save USD 5.6 billion in costs and 332 million tons of CO2 per year. In India, 70% of coal capacity is more expensive to run than building new renewables; in Germany it is 100%. Retiring all the uneconomic coal plants around the world and replacing them with renewables would save USD 32 billion and 3 giga tons of CO2 annually, 9% of the mankind????????s energy-related emissions. Is not this a worthwhile legacy for COP26? Note, this cost competitiveness is not the result of government subsidy. IRENA[4] notes that ???????offshore wind can now compete with price levels seen in the wholesale electricity market, without financial support???????. Additionally, ???????74 per cent of all new solar PV projects commissioned over the next two years that have been competitively procured through auctions and tenders will have an award price lower than new coal power???????. The skepticism some people still hold for solar PV may be due to an outdated understanding of costs as the technology was not always as cost competitive as it is now. The UK government????????s department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)[5] has produced estimates for the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of different technologies in the United Kingdom since 2010. Figure 1 shows the estimates for plants commissioning in 2025. The 2020 estimate for large-scale solar PV is 55% below the estimate made in 2012. Solar PV is now cheaper than nuclear, combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT), with and without carbon capture and storage, and offshore wind. Large-scale solar has reached cost parity with onshore wind which has also enjoyed a significant reduction in cost over the last 8 years. Note these costs no longer benefit from any government subsidies. In fact, solar PV projects were not even eligible for the United Kingdom????????s Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme from 2016, a decision that was only reversed in 2021. Despite the UK government????????s preferential treatment of offshore wind projects, solar PV projects, such as Cleve Hill in Kent, have continued to be built in the United Kingdom in recent years without government support. LCOE for large-scale solar decreases as one moves to lower latitudes than the United Kingdom (55????N) due to higher rates of insolation. The cost of a solar PV plant also varies around the world due to factors such as local wage rates (which affect installation costs), financing, and permits. IRENA estimates the cost per kW to build commercial scale solar PV in the United Kingdom was $1545 in 2020 versus $849 in Spain, $691 in China, and $651 in India. IRENA estimates the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of commercial scale solar PV in the UK was $179 per MWh in 2020 compared to $75 in Spain, $60 in China, and $55 in India. The higher cost in the United Kingdom reflects the higher build cost and lower levels of insolation. However, the UK LCOE compares favorably with France ($131), Japan ($132), and parts of the United States (e.g., California $130, Massachusetts $190, and New York $188). The UK government????????s Net Zero Strategy paper[6] notes that ???????a low-cost, net zero consistent electricity system is most likely to be composed predominantly of wind and solar generation, whether in 2035 or 2050. To ensure the system is reliable, intermittent renewables need to be complemented by known technologies such as nuclear and power CCUS [carbon capture, utilization, and storage], and flexible technologies such as interconnectors, electricity storage, and demand-side response.??????? These are all part of a developed energy market with a mixed basket of energy supply sources. The UK government????????s policy is informed by BEIS, which in 2020 published its estimates for ???????enhanced levelized costs??????? of electricity which take into account the intermittency of renewables. CCGT plants are dispatchable, that is, they can be brought online at short notice to meet peaks in demand, whereas wind and solar are not. Similarly, gas, coal, and nuclear plants can be relied upon to generate a specific amount of energy at expected times of strong demand (e.g., a winter evening). The intermittency of renewables requires more balancing of the electricity system for the supply to be kept in line with demand. It is expected that the best energy supply strategy for the United Kingdom will be a mixture of solar, wind, nuclear, and interconnectors with mainland Europe. The lower load factor for solar in winter should be partly mitigated by higher wind loading thereby reducing seasonal fluctuations in energy supply. The BEIS has calculated the enhanced levelized costs, which take these wider system impacts into account, under six scenarios (three different generation mixes and two different long-term electricity demand levels). Figure 2 shows the results of the six scenarios as dots overlaid on top of the basic LCOE estimate bar chart. The adjustments lower the LCOE for CCGT and CCGT plus CCUS but increase LCOE for wind and solar. The average of the six scenarios for plants commissioning in 2025 is lowest for CCGT. However, for 2030, the average estimate is lowest for large-scale solar. For 2035, the average is also lowest for large-scale solar though CCGT plus CCUS is close. BEIS????????s estimate assumes that by 2035 CCUS cost savings can be achieved through experience and technological improvements. Note nuclear is not considered because its LCOE (????102/MWh for plants commissioning in 2025) is higher than all the other options considered. Note, the BEIS???????? adjustments are higher than those suggested by an Imperial College study[7] which for large-scale solar PV add ????8.1????????17.4 per MWh to the basic LCOE versus an addition of ????11????????29 per BEIS (36????????67% higher). Nonetheless, even with the BEIS???????? estimates large-scale solar compares very favorably with any of the alternatives. As the proportion of electricity that comes from intermittent, nondispatchable renewables increases, there will be an increased need to balance supply and demand on a daily and seasonal basis. This balancing can be achieved using dispatchable power sources such as new bioenergy plants and existing CCGT plus CCUS plants. It can also be achieved through interconnections with other countries???????? grids. Guaranteeing the reliability of electricity supply will also require an increase in energy storage systems. These will need to be more distributed, with different demand time cycles, and linked to specialized smart local grids for optimum performance. The dominant form of electrical energy storage today, globally and in the United Kingdom, is pumped hydro. However, suitable locations where two reservoirs can be constructed nearby at significantly different altitudes are rare in the United Kingdom, especially given concerns over nature preservation. Nonetheless, the National Grid[8] expects pumped hydro in the United Kingdom to increase by around 25% from approximately 4 GW in 2030 (2.8 GW in 2019 per[9]) to 5 GW in 2050 according to its Consumer Transformation model (assumes 2050 net zero target is met) as shown in Figure 3. Moreover, the pumped hydro will be used more often and as such the energy stored will almost triple from approximat",CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Post???????COP26: Who is Responsible to Curb the Flow?

Since climate considerably influences vehicle performance, and cooling requires more energy than heating, a sweltering condition is studied. Added to this, New York City, a populous megacity, has been selected to dynamically evaluate the behavior of FCVs in real-world driving cycles. The findings suggest that the HVAC system can alter both the electricity consumption of EVs and the hydrogen consumption of FCVs in real-world driving cycles. In light of this, activating the air conditioning (AC) unit during a 10-min ride will cause a 33% energy consumption increase in EVs. This number reaches a significant 55% for the case of FCVs. The results also show that not only would a 20% reduction in battery state-of-health (SOH) consequently cause a 34.5% decrease in the driving range, but also the effect of battery health is more than that of the fuel cell.

Known as FreedomCAR (derived from 'Freedom' and 'Cooperative Automotive Research'), it represents DOE's commitment to developing public/private partnerships to fund high-risk, high-payoff research into advanced automotive technologies. Efficient fuel cell technology, which uses hydrogen to power automobiles without air pollution, is a very promising pathway to achieve the ultimate vision. The new partnership replaces and builds upon the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles initiative that ran from 1993 through 2001. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL's) Advanced Power Electronics and Electric Machines (APEEM) subprogram within the Vehicle Technologies Program provides support and guidance for many cutting-edge automotive technologies now under development. Research is focused on understanding and improving the way the various new components of tomorrow's automobiles will function as a unified system to improve fuel efficiency. In supporting the development of advanced vehicle propulsion systems, the APEEM effort has enabled the development of technologies that will significantly improve efficiency, costs, and fuel economy. The APEEM subprogram supports the efforts of the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership through a three-phase approach intended to: (1) identify overall propulsion and vehicle-related needs by analyzing programmatic goals and reviewing industry's recommendations and requirements and then develop the appropriate technical targets for systems, subsystems, and component research and development activities; (2) develop and validate individual subsystems and components, including electric motors and power electronics; and (3) determine how well the components and subsystems work together in a vehicle environment or as a complete propulsion system and whether the efficiency and performance targets at the vehicle level have been achieved. The research performed under this subprogram will help remove technical and cost barriers to enable the development of technology for use in such advanced vehicles as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs (PHEVs), all electric vehicles, and fuel-cell-powered automobiles that meet the goals of the Vehicle Technologies Program. A key element in making these advanced vehicles practical is providing an affordable electric traction drive system. This will require attaining weight, volume, and cost targets for the power electronics and electrical machines subsystems of the traction drive system. Areas of development include these: (1) novel traction motor designs that result in increased power density and lower cost; (2) inverter technologies involving new topologies to achieve higher efficiency, with the ability to accommodate higher-temperature environments while achieving high reliability; (3) converter concepts that employ means of reducing the component count and integrating functionality to decrease size, weight, and cost; (4) new onboard battery charging concepts that result in decreased cost and size; (5) more effective thermal control and packaging technologies; and (6) integrated motor/inverter concepts.

Seven typical Li-ion vent gas mixtures were selected based on published studies, and ignition and laminar flames were simulated. Modeling reveal a large variation in laminar burning velocity, flame temperature and heat release. Determining factors for laminar flames are the relative content of the carbonates and hydrogen gas, and the inert carbon dioxide. Gases from highly charged battery cells have the shortest ignition time at high temperatures and the fastest laminar burning velocity.

In analogy, electric powerboats and aircraft are also being proposed. Here we show as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have advantages vs. battery-only electric vehicles (BEVs) for all these applications. Adopting a hybrid propulsion system based on storing most of the energy in hydrogen, and producing electricity on board through a fuel cell (FC) stack, or an internal combustion engine (ICE) plus a generator, gives a much better techno-economic perspective, and reduced life cycle analysis CO2 emissions, than the use of huge lithium-ion batteries. An HEV having plug-in capability and a relatively small battery permits pure electric operation on short travel, without the burden of huge batteries to deliver range. The battery of the HEV buffers the upstream hybrid generation system, which may recharge the battery and/or power directly the electric motor, and store the braking energy in ground vehicles. HEVs fuel energy storage and onboard electricity generation on demand permit reduced total mass of the propulsion system for the same design range as huge batteries. HEVs with ICE working on hydrogen offers the minimum total mass of the propulsion system, then HEVs with FC.

The performance of the PEM fuel cell is affected by the temperature of input air that is drawn from the environment for electrochemical reaction with the hydrogen. Preheating the input air before it enters the PEM fuel cell can potentially improve its performance, especially during cold weather conditions.

This paper discusses the problem of abandoned batteries caused by the limited life of a large number of batteries with the prosperity of new energy vehicle industry. This paper lists and analyzes the different characteristics of batteries commonly used by three new energy vehicles in the market :(1) lead-acid batteries will not leak in the use process due to tight sealing, but their use cycle is very short. (2) The production of nickel metal hydride battery is relatively mature, its production cost is low, and compared with lithium electronic battery is safer. (3) Lithium-ion batteries are made of non-toxic materials, which makes them known as ???????green batteries???????. However, they are expensive to make and have poor compatibility with other batteries.

The effects of these additives on the electrochemical performance and the microstructure of the negative plate and on the HRPSoC cycle performance of the simulated test cell were investigated. The results indicate that the microstructure of the negative plate is changed with the addition of different additives. GO significantly increases the hydrogen (H2) evolution ability of the negative plate, while PPy has the opposite effect. The incorporation of the proper content of PPy with GO can effectively inhibit the H2 evolution of the negative plate. Moreover, adding different additives in the negative plate also decreases its total impedance, accelerates the redox processes between Pb and PbSO4 on it and increases its specific capacitance. GO and the PPy/GO composite with mpy/mGO = 1:1 (PG1) can significantly increase the HRPSoC cycle life of the simulated test cell. Considering the H2 evolution performance and the HRPSoC cycle performance, the PPy/GO composites with a medium mpy/mGO ratio, such as PG1, may be the appropriate additives for the negative plate of lead-acid batteries.","Effects of PPy, GO and PPy/GO composites on the negative plate and on the high-rate partial-state-of-charge performance of lead-acid batteries",NA,0.196806,-1

We investigate the influence of various microgrid design and operation strategies regarding their contribution to profitability and decarbonisation in an optimisation study.

40941249,Power Management Strategy|Battery Life Optimization|Control Strategies,"Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles have the advantages of zero emission, high efficiency and fast refuelling, etc. and are one of the key directions for vehicle development. The energy management problem of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles is the key technology for power distribution. The traditional power following strategy has the advantage of a real-time operation, but the power correction is usually based only on the state of charge of a lithium battery, which causes the operating point of the fuel cell to be in the region of a low efficiency. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid power-following-fuzzy control strategy, where a fuzzy logic control strategy is used to optimise the correction module based on the power following strategy, which regulates the state of charge while correcting the output power of the fuel cell towards the efficient operating point. The results of the joint simulation with Matlab + Advisor under the Globally Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Cycle Conditions show that the proposed strategy still ensures the advantages of real-time energy management, and for the hydrogen fuel cell, the hydrogen consumption is reduced by 13.5% and 4.1% compared with the power following strategy and the fuzzy logic control strategy, and the average output power variability is reduced by 14.6% and 5.1%, respectively, which is important for improving the economy of the whole vehicle and prolonging the lifetime of fuel cell.",Real-Time Energy Management Strategy of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles Based on Power Following Strategy????????Fuzzy Logic Control Strategy Hybrid Control,NA,0.692414,1
40941250,Electric Vehicles,"IntroductionInternal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) have experienced continuous development in manufacturing technology, materials science, motor performance, vehicle control, driver comfort and security for more than a century.Such ICEV evolution was accompanied by the creation of a huge network of roads, refuelling stations, service shops and replacement part manufacturers, dealers and vendors.No doubt, these fantastic industrial activities and business have had a central role in shaping the world and, in many aspects, the society as well.Today, the number of ICEV models and applications is astonishing, ranging from small personal transport cars to a hundred passenger buses, to heavy load and goods transportation trucks and heavy work caterpillars.Modern ICE vehicles encompass top comfort, excellent performance and advanced security, for relatively low prices and, needless to say, have become since the beginning the most attractive consumer products.However, despite approximately a century-long industry and academia struggle to improve ICE efficiency, this is, and will continue to be, incredibly low.As illustrated in Fig. 1, solely circa 30% of the energy produced in the ICE combustion reaction is converted into mechanical power.In other words, approximately 70% of the energy liberated by combustion is lost.In fact and worse than that, the wasted energy of thermal motors, as ICEs may be called, is transformed into motor and exhaust gases heat.The exhaust gases are a blend formed mostly of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and, to a lower extent, nitrogen oxides (NO x ), hydrocarbons (C x H y ), carbon monoxide (CO) and soot.Carbon dioxide is known to block the earth's radiation emissions back into the outer space thus promoting global temperature rise -the so-called greenhouse effect.This, climate researchers say, is silently creating other global catastrophic changes, as for example, sea level rise.Air pollution in big cities is another serious problem caused by exhaust gases, which leads to respiratory system diseases, including lung cancer.Disturbing noise level is another issue related to big fleet of ICEVs in big cities.Yet, this brings about another headache for city administrators and authorities: the daily jamming, though this last nuisance might be alleviated only by mass transport systems (i.e., subways and trains).Whether none of the above listed problems ever existed, yet a challenging situation had to be dealt with urgently: the finite amount of fossil fuel available for an ever-increasing world fleet.As petrol wells vanish, this commodity price skyrockets, also motivated by political tension around production areas in Middle East.On the other hand, renewable energy www.intechopen.comElectric Vehicles -The Benefits and Barriers 2 sources, like ethanol produced from sugarcane or maize crops, are an alternative solution being tried in some countries.In Brazil, for instance, sugarcane bio-fuel is an established option, with more than two decades on the road, with ICE automobiles prepared to run interchangeably on gasoline or ethanol automatically.Any driver could choose which fuel type to use at the refuelling station, much based on their prices.There is a criticism over this solution as regards to the demands on food availability and prices, once crop fields are used to produce bio-fuels instead of food.Greenhouse effect gas generation and air pollution problems are still present though to a somewhat lower extent.Fig. 1.ICEs are very inefficient energy converters as compared to electric motors An accurate look at Fig. 1 reveals that electric motors are far superior to ICE and could do an excellent job in propulsion of vehicles, helping to solve the serious climate, air pollution and noise problems created by ICEVs.As a matter of fact, electric vehicles (EVs) were invented in 1834, before ICE vehicles, being manufactured by several companies of the U.S.A, England, and France (Chan, 2007).Fig. 2(a) shows a picture of commercial EV in 1920.Poor performance of their batteries contrasting to fast development of ICE technology, extremely high energy density and power density of gasoline and petrol, and the abundance and low price offer of fossil fuel, all conspired against those days' EVs that rapidly became defunct.Interestingly, more than 150 years later, triggered by the world energy crisis in the 1970s, EVs entered the agendas of world's greatest carmakers, governments' energy and climate policy, and of worldwide non-governmental organizations worried about environmental pollution and greenhouse effect.Today, although their sales are negligible in relation to that of ICEVs, pure EVs and hybrid EVs (HEVs), i.e., those that combine ICE with electrical machines fed by batteries or fuel cells (hydrogen derived electricity), are offered by world's greatest carmakers.The performance of HEVs, from the driver's standpoint, rivals or outdoes that of modern ICEVs.Their energy consumption ranges from circa 10% to 70% lower than that of an equivalent ICE car, depending on their power, battery size, control strategy, etc.For the sake of illustration, until 2008, Toyota Prius, the world's first commercially mass-produced and marketed HEV, sold over 500,000 units on the world's market (Xiang et al., 2008).Fig. 2(b) shows a photograph of a modern 2010 Toyota Prius HEV whose selling price begins at 23,000 USD.The dramatic gain in energy efficiency, besides much lower or zero gas emission and noisefree operation, is due to the much higher efficiency of electric motors and control strategies such as regenerative braking and storage of excess energy from the ICE during coasting.www.intechopen.com",A Survey on Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technology,NA,0.694023,1

This paper focuses on the design and sizing optimization of the entire system and delivers three main contributions. First, this paper proposes a REVB model based on the model of capacity fading of lithium battery cells, which could allow a more realistic result for the design. Second, a power management strategy is presented to regulate the energy flow, for protecting the REVB and other system components. Third, multiple objectives are considered in the optimization model, including minimizing loss of power supply, system cost, and a new indicator, namely, potential energy waste.

Firstly, the WT method is employed to separate power demand of vehicles into high-frequency part supplied by supercapacitor and low-frequency part allocated to fuel cell and battery, which can effectively reduce the fluctuation of fuel cell and battery to prolong their lifespan. Then, considering the low-frequency power, the optimal SOC of battery is used to design the equivalent factor of the ECMS method to improve the fuel economy. The proposed hierarchical EMS can realize a trade-off between the lifespan of power sources and fuel economy of vehicles.

40941256,Rechargeable Batteries,"The addition of supplementary carbon to lead????????acid batteries that are intended for use in emerging automotive duties can provide improvement in two aspects of performance. (i) In both hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles that are designed to preserve energy through the operation of regenerative-braking, conventional lead????????acid batteries exhibit a rapid decline in the efficiency of the recuperative charging (which can involve rates up to 30C1) and fail quickly as a result of an accumulation of lead sulfate on the negative plate. It has been widely reported that supplementary carbon ???????? either intimately mixed with the negative active-material or included as a separate component attached to the plate ???????? can enhance charge-acceptance. (ii) Full-hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles employ high-voltage batteries composed of large numbers of cells connected in series. Consequently, when conventional lead????????acid batteries are used in such configurations, the continuous cycling encountered in normal driving will almost certainly lead to divergence in the states-of-charge of the unit cells and thereby demand periodic equalization charges. In this application, it has been demonstrated that lead????????acid batteries with supplementary carbon incorporated into the negative plate are rendered immune to the divergence problem and therefore operate without the need for an equalization charge. The inclusion of supplementary carbon does, however, promote hydrogen evolution and failure due to the loss of water from the electrolyte solution. Current research efforts are directed towards methods by which this disadvantage can be mitigated without losing the benefits that the addition of carbon provides. This review covers the extensive research that has been conducted to understand the mechanism by which the additional carbon operates, the additional studies that have sought to identify the best types and optimum amounts of carbon that should be used, together with the most effective manner for their deployment.",Understanding the functions of carbon in the negative active-mass of the lead????????acid battery: A review of progress,NA,0.281136,-1
40941257,Hybrid Vehicles|Fuel Cell Vehicles,"The transport sector is one of the major parties responsible for carbon dioxide (CO2) and pollutants emissions in Europe. For this reason, one of the main commitments of the European Commission is its decarbonization by 2035/2040. To achieve this target, during the last decades, different propulsion technologies were developed such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in electric vehicles (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEV). The first two proposals can be considered as bridging technology between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the BEV because they offer at the same time comparable performance as conventional powertrains and improved efficiency. However, both technologies are struggling with the tightening of pollutants and CO2 limits. On the other hand, the BEV can offer zero emissions at the tailpipe, but it suffers from limited range capabilities and the lack of fast-charging infrastructures. Within this context, the fuel cell vehicle (FCV) appears as an interesting opportunity because it offers zero tailpipe emissions and equivalent refuelling time of the ICE. This article evaluates through mathematical simulations the performance of two fuel cell electric buses (FCEBs), which are supposed to work respectively in urban and highway driving conditions. The urban bus is equipped with a single fuel cell (FC) module of 85 kW-Net and an electric motor (EM) of 225 kW. The intercity bus is equipped with two FC modules with a total power of 170 kW-Net and two EMs of 225 kW each. A sensitivity to the battery capacity from 20 kWh to 40 kWh was performed for both FECBs. The power split between the FC module and the high-voltage battery was optimized with the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS). The two FCEBs were tested considering different portfolios of cycles: in the case of the urban bus in Braunschweig and the Standardized On-Road Test Cycles SORT1 and SORT2 were assumed as a reference, while cycles like the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HWFET), European Transient Cycle (ETC), and cruising at 100 km/h were assumed as reference for the intercity. Simulation results highlighted that the increase of battery capacity in the case of the urban bus from 20 kWh to 30 kWh reduces hydrogen (H2) consumption by 11% along the Braunschweig cycle. On the other hand, in the case of the intercity bus, the fuel consumption is less affected by the increase of capacity in the same range. In this case a reduction of 4.7% is estimated for the HWFET cycle, and it is less than 1% in the case of cruising conditions.",Design of Two Fuel Cell Buses for Public Transport According to Two Different Operating Scenarios: Urban and Motorway,NA,0.688846,1

The judicious choice of the energy management strategy not only allows for the best distribution of energy between the different sources, but also reduces the system's consumption, increases the life span of the used sources and fulfills the energy demand that affects the autonomy of the electric vehicle (EV). A novel hybrid control strategy based on the interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) technique is proposed while considering the battery State of Charge (SOC) and the hydrogen level operating conditions. PBC is a very powerful nonlinear technique, which uses important system information such as the system energy information.

40941273,Hydrogen Fuel Cells|Fuel Cell Durability,"City transport needs to be improved to reduce emissions and increase fuel flexibility and economy. Because electric drive trains display advantages of low emissions, renewable refuelling and improved performance compared to combustion vehicles, the benefits of hydrogen and fuel cells as range extenders of battery electric vehicles have become apparent, especially to obtain rapid refuelling times and 500-km range. This paper describes the situation in China where electric bikes have competed successfully with combustion bikes. Unfortunately, this has not proved effective for cars which are too heavy and consequently require increased energy storage capacity over present battery levels. Weight is therefore a primary factor in choosing the drive train. It is demonstrated that hydrogen can provide that energy storage for cars in the 500-kg mass range, augmenting the battery to extend the range from 100 km to 500 km, as demanded in standard gasoline vehicles. A theory of the weight influence in cars is presented and verified by experiments on the Microcab city car. A hydrogen fuel cell battery hybrid composite car of 7-kN weight has now been tested to give results better than all existing hydrogen cars in terms of low energy use. The new theory fitting these results shows how the sum of many car component losses as a function of weight resolves into a Coulomb curve. The conclusion is that Coulomb's Law can be used to predict city car energy demand quantitatively.

E620 battery module (600 V class 20 kWh) during cell overcharge. Data gathered from this test was consistent with SAE Electric Vehicle Battery Abuse Testing specification J2464 [1]. After cell overcharge failure and 24 A current flow for additional 60 minutes, battery was then discharged at 7.5 KW average power to 12% state of charge (SOC) and recharged back to 100% SOC. This overcharging test was performed on two cells. No hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas was detected during front cell (B1) test, and small amount (6.2 ppm peak) was measured outside the battery after center cell (F13) overcharge. An additional overcharge test was performed per UL Standard 1973 - Batteries for Use in Light Electric Rail (LER) Applications and Stationary Applications[2]. With the battery at 11% SOC and 280??C float temperature, an individual cell near the front (D1) was deliberately imbalanced by charging it to 62% SOC. The battery was then recharged to 100% SOC. In all three tests, the battery cell pack was stable and individual cell failure did not propagate to other cells.

This tremendous amount of energy is widely used from small portable application to gigawatt size power plant generation. It has been utilized for various off grid or standalone applications including for vehicles. However, the progress of Solar Car (SC) was unsatisfied. Unlike Hydrogen Car (HC) and Pure Electric Vehicle (PEV), there is no commercialize SC marketed yet. Many strategies contributed to the successful of HC and PEV such as supportive policy, taxation, facilities and private involvement. The main component of SC can be simplified and consists of the structure, photovoltaic (PV) module, rechargeable battery pack, electric motor and power management unit. Main issue for SC is how to match between energy require and supply. Researchers are trying to find multiple solution from various aspects. Thirty SC prototypes were developed globally by numerous parties and most of them from academic bodies or universities. The purpose of the development is for solar car racing and to break commercialization boundary. As far as technology is concern, to achieve self-powered SC is quite challenging.

The AVTA has tested over 200 advanced technology vehicles including full-size electric vehicles, urban electric vehicles, neighborhood electric vehicles, and internal combustion engine vehicles powered by hydrogen. Currently, the AVTA is conducting a significant evaluation of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) produced by major automotive manufacturers. The results are posted on the AVTA web page maintained by the Idaho National Laboratory. Through the course of this testing, the fuel economy of HEV fleets has been monitored and analyzed to determine the 'real world' performance of their hybrid energy systems, particularly the battery. The initial fuel economy of these vehicles has typically been less than that determined by the manufacturer and also varies significantly with environmental conditions.

The 2 most common battery cell technologies were tested: Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and mixed transition metal oxide (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, NMC) cathodes against graphite anodes, respectively. The cell types investigated were ???????pouch??????? cells, with similar physical dimensions, but the NMC cells have double the electric capacity of the LFP cells due to the higher energy density of the NMC chemistry, 7 and 14 Ah, respectively.Heat release rate (HRR) data and concentrations of toxic gases were acquired by oxygen consumption calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively.Results: The test results indicate that the state of charge (SOC) affects the HRR as well as the amount of toxic hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas formed during combustion. A larger number of cells increases the amount of HF formed per cell. There are significant differences in response to the fire exposure between the NMC and LFP cells in this study. The LFP cells generate a lot more HF per cell, but the overall reactivity of the NMC cells is higher. However, the total energy released by both batteries during combustion was independent of SOC, which indicates that the electric energy content of the test object contributes to the activation energy of the thermal and heat release process, whereas the chemical energy stored in the materials is the main source of thermal energy in the batteries.Conclusions: The results imply that it is difficult to draw conclusions about higher order system behavior with respect to HF emissions based on data from tests on single cells or small assemblies of cells. This applies to energy release rates as well. The present data show that mass and shielding effects between cells in multicell assemblies affect the propagation of a thermal event.",Fire Tests on E-vehicle Battery Cells and Packs,NA,0.515921,-1

The methodology considers the design features of an electric vehicle and evaluates its energy and power requirements as to fulfil a driving cycle. The work starts by weight minimizing a fuel cell taking into consideration its physical and electrochemical characteristics. Batteries and ultracapacitors are then sized according to their dynamic response features and considering specifications from commercial candidate cells, to propose an electric configuration and specify the baseline for a hybrid power plant. In order to illustrate the methodology, a crossover utility electric vehicle and a WLTC class I drive cycle are used. This work shows that by reducing the power plant size, power and energy requirements can also be minimized and the overall performance can be increased promoting fuel and costs savings. For comparison and to show the impact of weight minimization on the energy on board and cost, this work presents the energy and power required by different power plant configurations. Results showed that including ultracapacitors to the power plant offers more benefits, such as less stress on batteries, at a marginal initial cost compared to a case without ultracapacitors, where batteries should attend transients with a limited capability for energy recovery from regenerative breaking.

40941285,Fuel Cells,"Transport is almost entirely powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) burning petroleum-derived liquid fuels and the global demand for transport energy is large and is increasing. Available battery capacity will have to increase by several hundred fold for even light duty vehicles (LDVs), which account for less than half of the global transport energy demand, to be run on electricity alone. However the greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) would be worse than that of conventional vehicles if electricity generation and the energy used for battery production are not sufficiently decarbonized. If coal continues to be a part of the energy mix, as it will in China and India, and if power generation is near urban centers, even local urban air quality in terms of particulates, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide would get worse. The human toxicity impacts associated with the mining of metals needed for batteries are very serious and will have to be addressed. Large prior investments in charging infrastructure and electricity generation will be needed for widespread forced adoption of BEVs to occur. There will be additional costs in the short term associated with various subsidies required to promote such a change and in the longer term, the loss of revenue from fuel taxes which contribute significantly to public finances in most countries. ICEs will continue to power transport, particularly commercial transport, to a large extent for decades to come and will continue to improve. There will also be a role for low-carbon and other alternative fuels where they make sense. However such alternatives also start from a low base and face constraints on rapid and unlimited growth so that they are unlikely to make up much more than 10% of the total transport energy demand by 2040. As the energy system is decarbonized and battery technology improves there will be an increasing role for BEVs and hydrogen which could replace liquid hydrocarbons in transport and the required infrastructure will evolve. Meanwhile, there will certainly be increasing electrification, particularly of LDVs in the form of hybridization to improve ICEs.",Is it really the end of internal combustion engines and petroleum in transport?,NA,0.628592,1

40941287,State of Charge Estimation,"Transport-related activities represented 34% of the total carbon emissions in the UK in 2022 and heavy-duty vehicles (HGVs) accounted for one-fifth of the road transport greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Currently, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are considered as suitable replacements for diesel fleets. However, these technologies continue to face techno-economic barriers, creating uncertainty for fleet operators wanting to transition away from diesel-powered internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This paper assesses the performance and cost competitiveness of BEV and FCEV powertrain solutions in the hard-to-abate HGV sector. The study evaluates the impact of battery degradation and a carbon tax on the cost of owning the vehicles. An integrated total cost of ownership (TCO) model, which includes these factors for the first time, is developed to study a large retailer's HGV fleet operating in the UK. The modelling framework compares the capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) of alternative technologies against ICEVs. The TCO of BEVs and FCEVs are 11%????????33% and 37%????????78% higher than ICEVs; respectively. Despite these differences, by adopting a longer lifetime for the vehicle it can effectively narrow the cost gap. Alternatively, cost parity with ICEVs could be achieved if BEV battery cost reduces by 56% or if FCEV fuel cell cost reduces by 60%. Besides, the pivot point for hydrogen price is determined at ????2.5 per kg. The findings suggest that BEV is closer to market as its TCO value is becoming competitive, whereas FCEV provides a more viable solution than BEV for long-haul applications due to shorter refuelling time and lower load capacity penalties. Furthermore, degradation of performance in lithium-ion batteries is found to have a minor impact on TCO if battery replacement is not required. However, critical component replacement and warranty can influence commercial viability. Given the high costs, we propose financial incentives and vehicle tax reforms to reduce costs of critical components that will encourage the roll-out of zero emission HGVs.",A total cost of ownership analysis of zero emission powertrain solutions for the heavy goods vehicle sector,NA,0.781845,1

Model results are presented examining the utility of placing a hydrogen PEM fuel cell on-board a Miles Electric ZX40ST work truck NEV as an 'after-market add-on' range extender to the existing battery electric drive train, thereby creating a NEVx. Through the development and use of the Sandia-Miles-Altergy Range Test (SMART) model, we have examined the potential for a number of PEM fuel cell stack systems (with varying output power), combined with various hydrogen storage and electrical storage system configurations to achieve the desired range extension for a single 8-h work shift. Furthermore, we have evaluated the 'well-to-wheels' (WTW) and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, and assessed the costs (both capital and O&M) for the different NEVx configurations and operating profiles. This analysis demonstrates that a NEVx incorporating a PEM fuel cell range extender provides a viable means of providing the desired range (or equivalently the runtime) while increasing the vehicle's versatility and maintaining its zero-emissions rating. A 5 kW fuel cell system with 2.6 kg of hydrogen stored at 2265 psi in conventional steel cylinders can meet the demands of the low-power duty cycles envisioned for the NEVx. A slightly higher powered NEVx with a 7.5 kW fuel cell offers the same advantages in operating profiles that require more power, for example with frequent starts, sustained higher speeds, or hilly routes. While currently expensive, the total cost per mile of the fuel cell range extender is comparable to conventional gasoline vehicles. The WTW GHG emissions of the NEVx are 40%-85% lower than those for a comparable gasoline powered vehicle, depending on the particular drive profile and sources of both hydrogen and electricity. The analysis shows that a fuel cell range extender can maintain the vehicle battery pack at a high state of charge (SOC) throughout the operating profile, thereby extending overall battery life and reducing charging time. The fuel cell range extender is currently envisioned as a drop-in retrofit for the existing Miles Electric ZX40ST work truck. However, with sufficient demand, a fully integrated new vehicle system could be both more efficient and less expensive.

A drawback of storing electric energy in a battery is the comparable low energy density, low driving range and the higher propensity to deplete the energy storage before reaching the destination, especially at low ambient temperatures. When the battery is depleted, stranded vehicles can either be towed or recharged with a mobile recharging station. Several technologies of mobile recharging stations already exist, however, most of them use fossil fuels to recharge battery electric vehicles. The proposed novel zero emission solution for mobile charging is a combined high voltage battery and hydrogen fuel cell charging station. Due to the thermal characteristics of the fuel cell and high voltage battery (which allow only comparable low coolant temperatures), the thermal design for this specific application (available heat exchanger area, zero vehicle speed, air flow direction) becomes challenging and is addressed in this work. Experimental methods were used to obtain reliable thermal and electric power measurement data of a 30 kW fuel cell system, which is used in the Mobile Hydrogen Powersupply. Subsequently, simulation methods were applied for the thermal design and optimisation of the coolant circuits and heat exchangers. It is shown that an battery electric vehicle charging power of 22 kW requires a heat exchanger area of 1 m2, of which 60 % is used by the fuel cell heat exchanger and the remainder by the battery heat exchanger to achieve steady state operation at the highest possible ambient temperature of 43,6 ????C. Furthermore, the simulation showed that when the charging power of 22 kW is solely provided by the high voltage battery, the highest possible ambient temperature is 42 ????C. When the charging power is decreased, operation up to the maximum ambient temperatures of 45 ????C can be achieved.

The powertrain of FCEV essentially comprises of a fuel cell stack and a DC/DC converter cascade along with its auxiliary subsystems, a Li-ion battery, and a supercapacitor cascaded to the powertrain via its DC/DC converter rendering the hybrid energy storage system in a semi- active configuration. The optimal sizing of battery and supercapacitor of the powertrain is arrived at by solving an integrated optimization problem that minimizes fuel consumption and degradation of the battery for a specified drive cycle used in the reported literature. The Dynamic Programming (DP) problem has an objective function to minimize the weighted fuel consumption, (i.e., the hydrogen consumption) along with the battery capacity loss i.e., maximization of battery life and better utilization of the battery. This is achieved in terms of throughput of and stress on the battery by the virtue of limiting the power transients/C-Rates while sustaining the battery charge at the end of the drive cycle. The DP problem is solved for a range of killoWattHour capacity rating of battery and supercapacitor.

This manuscript proposes a hybrid technique for the energy management (EM) of a battery-based FC electric vehicle (FCEV) system. The proposed hybrid method is a combination of a jellyfish search optimizer (JSO) and a Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA). Hence, known as the JSO-RSA method.

40941310,Power Management Strategy|Model Predictive Control|Fuel Cell Durability|PEM Fuel Cells|Battery Life Optimization,"Due to the poor dynamic response ability of the fuel cell, the battery is normally applied to integrate with fuel cell to configure the hybrid power system in electric vehicles. In this paper, a vehicle speed prediction model predictive control (SP-MPC) energy management strategy is developed for the hybrid power system in fuel cell electric vehicles. The main principle of the proposed SP-MPC is that the future vehicle total power demand is forecasted via the Markov speed predictor and imported into the energy management system response prediction model to improve the control performance by more accurate disturbance description. The objective function is set for equivalent hydrogen consumption minimization and fuel cell degradation inhibition. As a contrast, the normal MPC strategy, the speed prediction dynamic programming (SP-DP) strategy and the DP offline strategy are formulated. Comparing with the normal MPC strategy, the SP-MPC strategy has a 3.74% reduction in the total operation cost under MANHATTAN condition. The SP-MPC strategy also has a 1.39% reduction in the total operation cost than the SP-DP strategy. Moreover, two scenarios are introduced with different disturbance prediction accuracy to verify the influences of the prediction inaccuracy on the SP-MPC and SP-DP results. For SP-DP strategy, the total operation cost under actual forecast scenario has increased by 5.03% compared with the perfect forecast scenario. The similar result can be seen in the SP-MPC, but the increase between perfect and actual forecast scenario is only 1.02%, which indicates a better robustness to the disturbance prediction inaccuracy compared with the SP-DP strategy. A DSP hardware in loop (HIL) test is conducted for real-time performance verification of the proposed SP-MPC.",Real-time energy management for fuel cell electric vehicle using speed prediction-based model predictive control considering performance degradation,NA,0.691545,1

40941313,High-Temperature Operation|Thermodynamic Modeling|Thermal Management|Battery Management Systems,"Proper thermal management is important for optimum performance and durability of most electric-vehicle batteries. For high-temperature cells such as sodium/sulphur, a very efficient and responsive thermal control system is essential. Heat must be removed during exothermic periods and retained when the batteries are not in use. Current thermal management approaches rely on passive insulation enclosures with active cooling loops that penetrate the enclosure. This paper presents the design, analysis, and testing of an enclosure with variable conductance insulation (VCI). VCI uses a hydride with an integral electric resistance heater to expel and retrieve a small amount of hydrogen gas into a vacuum space. By controlling the amount of hydrogen gas, the thermal conductance can be varied by more than 100:1, enabling the cooling loop (cold plate) to be mounted on the enclosure exterior. By not penetrating the battery enclosure, the cooling system is simpler and more reliable. Also, heat can be retained more effectively when desired. For high temperatures, radiation shields within the vacuum space are required. Ceramic spacers are used to maintain separation of the steel enclosure materials against atmospheric loading. Ceramic-to-ceramic thermal contact resistance within the spacer assembly minimizes thermal conductance. Two full-scale (0.8-m {times} 0.9-m {times} 0.3-m) prototypes were designed, built, and tested under high-temperature 200{degrees}-350{degrees}C battery conditions. With an internal temperature of 330{degrees}C (and 20{degrees}C ambient), the measured total-enclosure minimum heat loss was 80 watts (excluding wire pass-through losses). The maximum heat rejection was 4100 watts. The insulation can be switched from minimum to maximum conductance (hydrogen pressure from 2.0 {times} 10{sup -3} to 8 torr) in 3 minutes. Switching from maximum to minimum conductance was longer (16 minutes), but still satisfactory because of the large thermal mass of the battery.",Thermal management of batteries using a Variable-Conductance Insulation (VCI) enclosure,NA,0.42373,-1

Main contentEV or hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) are mainly used secondary battery in power batteries.Than any other batteries, Ni-MH battery has many advantages: rapid charge or discharge high current, high resistance to charging and discharging capacity, low temperature performance, high mass-power ratio, environmentally friendly (no cadmium mercury or lead) and so on [16].Therefore, this paper studies how to fast and accurately track the SOC based on Ni-MH battery.This paper designs an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting Ni-MH batteries in EVs.For achieving the predictability of the network, the text use some basic characteristics of the ANN algorithm such as the ability of non-linear mapping, adapting to the selflearning, parallel processing method, and so on [16][17].The influence between the current SOCt of Ni-MH battery and the previous SOCt-1 is not considered in most of published paper for the sake of tracking SOC by ANN when they select input variable.So the previous SOCt-1 is interpolated into input variable in this paper.That is to say, the input variable of this discourse are: battery discharging current I, battery terminal voltage U, and previous SOCt-1.Through training a lot of samples, ANN can study and adapt the unknown system's dynamic characteristics, and the characteristic will conserve inside the connected weight of ANN.Simulation results show that the proposed ANN algorithm can accurately predict Ni-MH hybrid vehicle battery SOC, and the average error of output results to reach about 5% in a short time.

The case for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) has been greatly enhanced by significant recent improvements in lithium batteries. New lithium batteries have about three times greater energy density than nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries. BEVs with lithium batteries are similar to hydrogen fuel cell electric cars. In both, the primary energy source may be the same. Energy sources include oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydropower, wind, and direct solar energy. These sources can power both types of vehicles when converted to an energy carrier, which could be electricity or hydrogen. Fuel cell vehicles use hydrogen as well as electricity energy carriers, but in both cases the end point is the same: mechanical energy delivered to the drive wheels. Both vehicles use electric motors and power electronics after the primary energy source passes through an electrochemical step. It is also true for both vehicle types that the possibility of avoiding oil use exists.

40941319,Battery Management Systems,"Full-profile, Rietveld-type, x-ray powder diffraction studies have been performed on ??-PbO2samples either prepared chemically or obtained from batteries operated under simulated electric vehicle service at 25?? and 50??C. After a sharp initial decrease, the unit cell volume and cell edge ratio of battery ??-PbO2assume relatively stable values which are both independent of the battery capacity and indistinguishable from those of chemically prepared material. A comparison of the observed unit cell volumes with values calculated for given levels of O2-/(OH)-, Pb4+/Pb2+coupled substitution in the ??-PbO2structure indicates that the maximum amount of this substitution is about 0.01 atoms of hydrogen per formula unit. These results suggest that the decline in battery capacity is not a function of the loss of a hydrogen species from the crystal structure of electrochemically active ??-PbO2. Estimates of the changes in PbO2crystallite size as a function of battery cycling history show that batteries began service with ??-PbO2crystallite sizes of around 250A, irrespective of the temperature of operation, but increased to values of about 700 and 900?? at 25?? and 50??C, respectively. Since this increase in crystallite size occurred well before battery failure, the loss in battery capacity with cycling cannot be correlated with the changes in crystallite size and, therefore, with changes in the degree of structural order of the active material. ?? 1984, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

40941320,Power Management Strategy|Battery Life Optimization|Battery Management Systems|Energy Storage Systems,"The use of multi-stack fuel cells (FCs) is attracting considerable attention in electrified vehicles due to the added degrees of freedom in terms of efficiency and survivability. In a multi-stack FC hybrid electric vehicle, the power sources (FCs and the battery pack) have different energetic characteristics and their operation is influenced by the performance drifts caused by degradation. Hence, efficient power distribution for such a multi-source system is a critical issue. This paper proposes a three-layer online EMS for a recreational vehicle composed of three FCs and a battery pack. In the first layer, two online estimators are responsible for constantly updating the characteristics of each FC and the battery to be used by the power distribution algorithm. In the second layer, a rule-based method is developed to improve the calculation speed of the power distribution algorithm by deciding when it should be activated. The last layer performs the power distribution between FCs and battery using a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called Q-learning. The proposed RL-based EMS attempts to meet the requested power while minimizing the costs of hydrogen consumption and degradation of all power sources. To justify the performance of the proposed strategy, a comprehensive benchmark with an offline EMS and two online strategies is performed under two driving cycles. In comparison with the online strategies, the proposed method based on RL reduces the defined trip cost up to 11.5 % and 13.08 % under the Real driving cycle while having a higher cost than the offline strategy by 4.78 %.",Q-learning based energy management strategy for a hybrid multi-stack fuel cell system considering degradation,NA,0.587763,1

Extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) charged by small internal combustion engines become an alternative choice because EREVs have longer range and higher efficiency than battery-based electric vehicles, such as lithium battery-based vehicles.

The system is configured as a microgrid, including photovoltaic generation, a lead-acid battery as a short term energy storage system, hydrogen production, and several loads. In this microgrid, an energy management strategy has been incorporated that pursues several objectives. On the one hand, it aims to minimize the amount of energy cycled in the battery, in order to reduce the associated losses and battery size. On the other hand, it seeks to take advantage of the long-term surplus energy, producing hydrogen and extracting it from the system, to be used in a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle. A crucial factor in this approach is to accommodate the energy consumption to the energy demand and to achieve this, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed. In this context, proper models for solar estimation, hydrogen production, and battery energy storage will be presented. Moreover, the controller is capable of advancing or delaying the deferrable loads from its prescheduled time. As a result, a stable and efficient supply with a relatively small battery is obtained.
