A step-down DC/DC power converter is incorporated to actively control the power flow between the fuel cell and the battery to achieve both high power and high energy densities. The results show that the hybrid power source can achieve much greater specific power and power density than the fuel cell alone. This paper first demonstrates that an actively controlled hybrid with a 35W hydrogen-fueled polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and a lithium-ion battery pack of six cells yielded a peak power of 100W, about three times as high as the fuel cell alone can supply, while causing a very limited (10%) weight increase to the whole system. After that, another hybrid source using a different battery array (eight cells) was investigated to further validate the control strategy and to show the flexibility and generality of the hybrid source design. The experimental data show that the hybrid source using an eight-cell battery supplied a peak power of 135W, about four times that of the fuel cell alone. Finally, three power sources including the fuel cell alone and the two hybrids studied were compared in terms of specific power, power density, volume, weight, etc. The design presented here can be scaled to larger or smaller power capacities for a variety of applications. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, the most recent works are focusing on optimizing hydrogen consumption, without taking into consideration the degradation of embedded energy sources. In order to overcome this lack of knowledge, this paper describes a new health-conscious EMS algorithm based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), which aims to minimize the battery degradation to extend its lifetime. In this proposed algorithm, the health-conscious EMS is normalized in order to address its multi-objective optimization. Then, weighting factors are assigned in the objective function to minimize the selected criteria. Compared to most EMSs based on optimization techniques, this proposed approach does not require any information about the speed profile, which allows it to be used for real-time control of FCHEV. The achieved simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the economic cost up to 50% for some speed profile, keeping the battery pack in a safe range and significantly reducing energy sources degradation.

First, a linear parameter-varying (LPV) prediction model of the FC hybrid system that considers the system parameter variation is developed.

Infrastructure for hydrogen production, transportation, and allocation is essential for FCEV promotion. For consumers, availability of few hydrogen refuelling stations is the primary concern. Currently, public charging infrastructure for battery electric vehicles, for example, fast charging station, has a more widespread coverage compared to infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling. With an electrolyser, the existing power grid can be used as an alternative to hydrogen supply and transportation infrastructure, which is still being developed. The authors propose a new conceptual combo station acting as both a hydrogen refuelling station and a fast charging station. This station can satisfy the requirement of FCEVs and battery electric vehicles, and even operate under a blackout situation. To quantify the value of coordinated operation, an optimal operation formulation of a combo station is developed. It is found that such a combo station is capable of saving land rents, reducing power network reinforcement cost, and boosting energy self-balance capability under blackout condition. 1 INTRODUCTION Hydrogen can easily be stored, and electricity is convenient for transportation. Their complementary characteristics allow for an efficient usage of highly uncertain renewable energy sources. By decoupling the production and consumption of energy, energy can be stored and need not be consumed instantly. This significantly reduces the curtailment of renewable energy generation [1]. Hydrogen has one of the highest energy density values per mass and does not emit greenhouse gases during consumption; thus, it is suitable for the transportation sector. As pointed out in [2], approximately 25% of primary energy consumption and global CO 2 emission is attributed to the transport sector, primarily road transport. Compared with the battery electric vehicle (BEV), the refuelling rate of the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is much faster, and typically, the FCEV offers better mileage. Therefore, hydrogen is considered as an alternative fuel for future road transport. The development of hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs) and FCEV cannot be carried out independently. FCEVs can obtain hydrogen conveniently after an adequate number of HRSs are available, and this will also promote the usage of FCEVs. However, at the early stage of adopting FCEVs, HRS will face the challenges of expensive hydrogen supply and low hydrogen demand because of the undeveloped infrastructure of hydrogen production and transportation; these challenges directly hinder the construction of HRSs. The results presented in [3] highlight that it is essential to build sufficient HRSs to promote the growth of FCEVs in the early stages. To address the problem of ???????chicken and egg???????? [2], the transition scheme of hydrogen production on-site was proposed. There are two common methods to produce hydrogen on-site: Water electrolysis. Many researches have been conducted on economic evaluation of on-site water electrolysis. Results presented in [4] indicate that the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) is $7.72/kg with hydrogen production capacities of 300 Nm 3 / h , considering capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX), including equipments, maintenances, labors, and land rents. The LCOH varies in a wide range because of different energy sources and equipment costs, such as ???????10.3/kg in [5], $6.24/kg in [6], and ???????5.0 /kg for alkaline electrolysis in [7]. Steam methane reforming (SMR). This method is commonly used to produce hydrogen in industry. In SMR method, natural gas is required for production of hydrogen. Therefore, natural gas rather than hydrogen will be transported into the station, and SMR is not a low-carbon method to produce hydrogen. The LCOH is $6.8/kg in Shenzhen [8], $9/kg in California [9], and $7.59/kg in Korea [4]. Although SMR usually has the advantage of low cost, it is preferable that hydrogen is produced from renewable sources. Moreover, for the areas where natural gas cannot be transported, using water electrolysis, such as PEM, can serve as an ideal alternative. As pointed out in [10], with an electrolyser, the existing power grid can be used for supplying hydrogen in all places. Because PEM-based on-site hydrogen production can be flexibly controlled, PEM-based on-site production HRSs are usually combined with uncertain wind [11, 12] or solar [13-15]. Therefore, the HRSs can use wind and solar energy to produce hydrogen, participate in power market, and provide ancillary services for power grid. An economic assessment of centralised hydrogen production and on-site hydrogen production is comprehensively studied in [16]. From the perspective of efficiency and capital expenditures, central hydrogen production and truck delivery are advantageous. However, on-site production allows small gas inventory, more compact stations, high gas purity, and carbon-free emission. PEM on-site hydrogen production is more suitable for station with hydrogen demand less than 75,000 scf/day (approximately 180 kg/day) [17]. Considering the potential of on-site water electrolysis to reduce carbon footprint, many projects have been conducted to build on-site water electrolysis HRSs. Proton OnSite [18] is a company that has on-site water electrolysis HRSs in five cities in the U.S. and Germany. There is a solar-powered on-site hydrogen production HRS in Italy [13]. Furthermore, as pointed out in [19], approximately 70% HRSs in North and South America are on-site production stations (using SMR or electrolyser); 58% in Europe and 64% in Asia. Out of the 224 HRSs globally, 65 are based on water electrolysis, of which 28 are using renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, and 35 are using grid electricity to produce hydrogen. The operation and control strategy of HRS with an electrolyser is studied in [20]. The result shows that a self-sustainable HRS that relies on renewable resources for hydrogen production, storage, and distribution is feasible. In [21], a hybrid refuelling station that can serve BEVs, FCEVs, and natural gas vehicles (NGVs) is proposed. An optimisation model considering operation constraints of different equipment is built to obtain an optimal operation. [22] considers three types of ancillary services to gain more benefits in both distributed and centralised hydrogen production. From the economic point of view, the results show that the distributed production is ideal. For a hydrogen refuelling station with a generation capacity of 100 kg, the land rents account for approximately 15????????27% of total O&M costs [23]. The current levels of utilisation of commercial chargers is below 10% [24]. The average utilisation rate of HRSs in California is 36% based on the station's hydrogen capacity [25]. An FCEV can be refilled in less than 10 min [26], and the rate of hydrogen production is high, approximately 89.9 kg/h [27]. Thus, low utilisation of FCSs and HRSs and high speed of refuelling make it possible for FCSs HRSs to share their parking spaces. Moreover, the grid connection fee for FCS and on-site HRS is high in Europe. Because the electrolysers and chargers do not operate 24/7, they can be operated coordinately to reduce peak power capacity [28]; this can save their grid connection fee. In this study, a combo station that acts as both a hydrogen refuelling and fast charging station is proposed. Its daily optimal operation models are built considering BEV charging facilities, batteries, hydrogen electrolysers, and hydrogen vessels under both normal and black-out conditions of power grid. Both operation models can be easily extended to scenario-based model c",Coordinated operation of hydrogen refuelling and fast charging combo station under normal and contingent conditions,Energy conversion and economics,Zhiyuan Bao|Shi You|Zechun Hu|Yilin Wen,https://doi.org/10.1049/enc2.12012

Electrification of the transportation industry offers the advantages of increased energy efficiency and reduced local pollutants. Electric Vehicles (EVs) are environmentally friendly because they reduce fossil fuels usage even zero consumption, need fewer maintenance requirements, and lower operating costs than the vehicles powered by gasoline or diesel. However, this study focuses on comparing various energy management strategies (EMS) for a backup energy supply system for EVs. The hybrid power system (HPS) considered in this study includes DC-DC and DC-AC synchronous converters, as well as supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells. The EMS analyzed includes state machine control, classical proportional-integral control, equivalent consumption minimization, frequency decoupling, rule-based fuzzy logic, and fuzzy logic control. The HPS's efficiency, hydrogen fuel, supercapacitor or battery state of charge levels, and overall performance are evaluated as primary efficiency criteria. Additionally, the HPS not only increases system energy but also reduces the number of pack batteries required. This study designs and constructs the combined power systems to enhance EV power schemes with rechargeable battery power supplies. The results show that a 6-kW fuel cell hybrid increases the power system capacity to 408 kWh. Moreover, a novel method based on wavelet transforms of the instantaneous power of each energy source is used to quantify the stressors on each energy source that impact its life cycle.

Just as battery electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles also offer locally emission free mobility. The drive system of fuel cell electric vehicles consists of a fuel cell system, an electric motor, power electronics, a hydrogen storage system as well as a rechargeable energy storage system, typically a battery. The quantified power ratio between the fuel cell system and the rechargeable energy storage system is referred to as the degree of hybridization, although inconsistent definitions are used. As these existing definitions of the degree of hybridization of fuel cell electric vehicles don't support a distinct differentiation and characterization of the vehicles, a new definition of the degree of hybridization is proposed considering the ratio of the energy contents of the hydrogen storage system and the rechargeable energy storage system, effectively adding a second dimension. The degree of hybridization is then evaluated for existing fuel cell electric vehicles using the proposed definition and enables the characterization and clustering of the different vehicles. While this two-dimensional degree of hybridization can be used as optimization criteria during the design and optimization of fuel cell drive systems, the aforementioned clusters can be assigned to already established qualitative degree of hybridization definitions used to describe types of hybrid electric vehicles.

PHEV technology provides the potential to displace a significant portion of transportation petroleum consumption by using electricity for portions of trips.

The built CS is high-efficient due to putting to practical use a proposed novel variable step-size maximum power point tracking (MPPT) scheme applied to both photovoltaic (PV) and wind parts of the CS. The main defect of a stand-alone CS is its necessity to battery banks which not only are expensive but also provide short lifetime due to a considerable number of daily charge and discharge imposed to them in a CS. This problem has been solved in this study by utilizing a FC system as supporting power source playing two roles. First, whenever PV and wind power production is less than charge demand, the FC system produces extra electric energy required. Second, whenever PV and wind power production is more than charge demand, the electrolyzer of the FC system produces hydrogen by absorbing extra electric power available in the system. Thus, the FC system acts as a high-capacity storage device in continuously regulating charging power to instant charge demand. The CS has been built, and experimental measurements obtained from its realistic operation are presented that prove the novelty and contributions of the constructed CS compared to those available as: ???

Electrified transportation exhibits great potential to provide flexibility. This article analyzed and compared the flexibility values of battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles for planning and operating interdependent electricity and hydrogen supply chains while considering battery degradation costs. A cross-scale framework involving both macro-level and micro-level models was proposed to compute the profits of flexible EV refueling/charging with battery degradation considered. Here we show that the flexibility reduction after considering battery degradation is quantified by at least 4.7% of the minimum system cost and enlarged under fast charging and low-temperature scenarios.

Recently, the energy needs of hydrogen electric vehicles, which have developed as an alternative to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and have significant potential in the future, are met by vehicular hydrogen FCs. In this regard, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which have started to take their place in the transportation sector, can also be used as an additional energy source with their energy unit for electrical power grid-connected systems. In grid-vehicle integration, vehicular FCs can meet a significant part of the electricity consumption when parked and help stabilize the grid. In this study, multiple vehicular PEM fuel cells (PEMFCs), the most widely used in FCEVs, support the residential grid by injecting electrical power into the connecting system. For this, a multi-input dc-dc boost converter interface is designed and utilized to manage electrical energy from vehicular PEMFCs to the electrical power grid instead of a conventional single-input dc-dc boost converter. In the dc-dc converter control, Incremental-Conductance (InC) maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method is utilized to extract maximum power from PEMFCs. Subsequently, the extracted electrical energy is supplied to the grid through a full-bridge inverter controlled by hysteresis pulse width modulation. The designed grid-support system supplied by vehicular PEMFCs in the ratings of 75 kW, 100 kW, and 125 kW are connected to local dynamic loads and analyzed for a 24-h operation. The minimum load consumption value is 84.6 kWh at midnight while load consumes at most 396.2 kWh during the daytime. Various connection situations of vehicular PEMFCs are considered to examine the energy flow analysis between vehicles and the grid/consumer side. A detailed economic analysis has been carried out by using hourly energy values in terms of load profile and generated energy to show the profit amount on the user side. While the cost of the energy consumed by the loads is calculated as ???1004.8 without connection to the grid of FCEVs, the amount of profit obtained on the load side is measured as ???943.9 with the connection.",Connecting multiple vehicular PEM fuel cells to electrical power grid as alternative energy sources: A Case Study,International journal of hydrogen energy,Mustafa İnci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.08.228

40941112,https://openalex.org,Vehicle-to-Grid,"Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles account for a substantial portion (25 %) of transport-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States. Efforts to reduce these emissions focus primarily on diesel hybrids, hydrogen fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles. However, these efforts ignore the high energy intensity of producing lithium (Li)-ion batteries and the carbon fiber used in fuel-cell vehicles. Here, we conduct a life-cycle analysis to compare the impacts of the vehicle manufacturing cycle for Class 6 (pickup-and-delivery, PnD) and Class 8 (day- and sleeper-cab) trucks with diesel, electric, fuel-cell, and hybrid powertrains. We assume that all trucks were manufactured in the US in 2020 and operated over 2021-2035, and we developed a comprehensive materials inventory for all trucks. Our analysis reveals that common systems (trailer/van/box, truck body, chassis, and lift-gates) dominate the vehicle-cycle GHG emissions (64-83 % share) of diesel, hybrid, and fuel-cell powertrains. Conversely, propulsion systems (lithium-ion batteries and fuel-cell systems) contribute substantially to these emissions for electric (43-77 %) and fuel-cell powertrains (16-27 %). These vehicle-cycle contributions arise from the extensive use of steel and aluminum, the high energy/GHG intensity of producing lithium-ion batteries and carbon fiber, and the assumed battery replacement schedule for Class 8 electric trucks. A switch from the conventional diesel powertrain to alternative electric and fuel-cell powertrains causes an increase in vehicle-cycle GHG emissions (by 60-287 % and 13-29 %, respectively) but leads to substantial GHG reductions when considering the combined vehicle- and fuel-cycles (Class 6: 33-61 %, Class 8: 2-32 %), highlighting the benefits of this shift in powertrains and energy supply chain.

To maximize the economic potential of fuel cell/battery-based hybrid electric vehicles, this paper proposes a real-time cost-minimization energy management strategy to mitigate the vehicle's operating cost. Specifically, the proposed strategy is realized via model predictive control, wherein both hydrogen consumption and energy source degradations are incorporated in the multi-objective cost function. Assisted by the forecasted speed, dynamic programming is leveraged to derive the optimal power-splitting decision over each receding horizon. Thereafter, the performance discrepancy of the proposed strategy is analyzed under different affecting factors, including battery state-of-charge regulation coefficient, discrete resolution of optimization solver, speed prediction approaches and length of prediction horizon. Lastly, a comparative study is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, where the proposed strategy can respectively reduce the operating cost and prolong the fuel cell lifetime by 14.17% and 8.48% in average versus a rule-based benchmark.

40941121,https://openalex.org,Electric Vehicles|Battery Technology|Battery Life Optimization,"Battery electric vehicles, otherwise called BEVs, are completely electric vehicles which runs on rechargeable batteries. They utilize energy which is put away in rechargeable battery packs, with no utilization of optional source, for example, gases, hydrogen energy unit, internal combustion engine, and so on. Rather than internal combustion engines (ICEs), BEVs utilize electric engines and engine controllers. During the eighteenth century, the possibility of an electric vehicle began and the advancement began. The principal successful electric car, known as The Electrobat, was created in 1894 utilizing lead batteries. Mechanical designer Henry G. Morris and scientific expert Pedro G. Salom in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania have created it. In 1895, William Morrison of Des Moines built up a six-wheeled electric vehicle (wagon) which was equipped for arriving at the speed of 23 km/h. Later on, the car organization General Motors (GM) in the mid-1960s made their first idea, The Electrovair utilizing a battery of silver and zinc which convey nearly 530 V. Decades later in 2008, Tesla Motors delivered their first battery electric vehicle (BEV), Roadster which utilized lithium-ion battery for traveling in excess of 320 km for every charge upto an extraordinary speed of 200 km/h. A portion of the renowned instances of BEVs are Chevy Bolt, Portage Focus Electric, Hyundai Ionic, Mitsubishi I-MiEV, Volkswagen e-Golf, and so forth. The Battery electric vehicle comprises of different parts which incorporate battery, charge port, DC/DC converter, electric traction motor, power electronics controller, a thermal system, traction battery pack, and so forth. Since these vehicles utilize electric engine rather than the internal combustion engine, along these lines, an enormous battery pack is expected for controlling the electric engine. For the charging of the enormous traction batteries, charging station or outlet is required, which isn't accessible all over the place and henceforth the expansion of BEVs is very troublesome. The working of the BEVs is to such an extent that the helper battery gives energy to control the frill of BEV. The vehicle has the charge port to interface with an external supply to charge the battery pack. The installed charger in it helps in changing over AC power to the DC capacity to charge the traction battery with the goal that it can store and give power to the engine. The vehicle has mounted a DC/DC converter to give a low voltage DC capacity to the components. The power from the battery pack is dealt with the electric engine which moves the wheels of the car. The torque created, and the speed of engine is controlled with the assistance of the power electronics controller, and it additionally manages the energy stream. A thermal system deals with the working temperature of the motor, and the electric transmission aids in moving the mechanical capacity to the drive wheels. This is the manner in which the vehicle moves. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) do not produce any sort of unsafe dangers, not at all like fuel-controlled vehicles or ordinary petroleum/diesel vehicles, and in this manner, they are profoundly condition cordial. Likewise, they have a low running expense of around 33% per kilometer when contrasted with regular vehicles. Considering every one of these variables, battery-worked vehicles are probably going to supplant regular ICE vehicles soon.",Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs),Green energy and technology,Faraz Ahmad|A.

Currently, electric vehicles (EVs) offer a source of mobility that emphasises the use of energy storage devices to reduce CO2 emissions. The growing development of advanced data analytics and the Internet of Things has driven the implementation of the Digital Twin (DT), all to improve efficiency in the build, design and operation of the system. Regarding the components of EVs, the batteries are considered as the most expensive elements to analyse according to the State of Health and the State of Charge, which lead to implement the most optimal models, along with a DT for battery systems. The present article provides a literature review about the current development trends of EVs' energy storage technologies, with their corresponding battery systems, which gives an overview to understand different type of models and to identify future challenges in the industrial sector. Additionally, a solid explanation of the DT focussed on battery systems for EVs is discussed, highlighting some study cases, characteristics, and technological opportunities. 1 INTRODUCTION The electric market has been a point of concern in the research and development (R&D) field across the world, which has given the potential use of electric vehicles (EVs) to support climate change emissions and improve the way of living. It has been a growing trend of EVs since the last decade due to several advantages and economic benefits they offer. In 2021, Sanguesa et al. [1] conducted a study that shows the current challenges and technologies for EVs; among the most important contributions, we find the simplicity and reliability of the manufacturing maintenance, operation efficiency, accessibility, comfort, and zero emissions. It is important to mention that EVs have been classified into several categories based on propulsion technologies. According to Refs. [1-3], the five categories are listed as follows : Battery EVs: This type of vehicle works using electric power; therefore, neither an internal combustion engine nor a liquid fuel is used in the operating mechanism Plug-in-hybrid EVs: Have the characteristics of being propelled by both an electric engine charged by a pluggable external source and a conventional combustible engine. It is fundamental to specify that this category of vehicles can be connected to the grid, which contributes to the reduction of fuel consumption in regular driving scenarios. Hybrid EVs: This category of vehicles is mobilised through electric and conventional motors, the battery that provides energy to the electric motor has the mechanism of being charged due to the one generated in the vehicle's combustion engine Extended-range EVs: This vehicle is equipped with a supplementary combustion engine that enables it to charge the battery when it is needed. It is important to say that the main difference in comparison with the plug-in hybrid and hybrid EVs relies on the engine that is used for charging purposes. Consequently, it does not integrate the connection of the wheels' vehicle. Fuel Cell EVs: This vehicle is provided with a fuel cell that works through chemical reactions, using a mix of compressed hydrogen and oxygen obtained from the air. One of the most critical elements of EVs is the batteries, which are expensive components that not only affect the overall cost but also their capacity and charging time. According to Ref. [4], the most expensive element in the EV is the battery pack. Regarding the performance of the battery in EVs, there are several challenges and limitations that have been a point of interest for the scientific community, which are bulk and weight, charging time, driving range, and battery cost. In the following sections, the challenges will be analysed and discussed to familiarise the reader with the aim and focus of this research. Currently, academic and industrial R&D institutions are focussed on different issues related to EVs' storage systems, some of which are the application of modelling to understand not only physical behaviour, but also the engineering framework of the system. According to the literature review, there are different categories of battery models, which are based on the properties of the batteries, available data, physical interpretation, mechanical and thermal analysis etc. [5]. This study will focus on three main categories, which are electrochemical, electrical, and mathematical, all because of the promising applications that are applied using these models in the sustainable and renewable field. Electrochemical models are defined as the most complex and precise due to the thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena that explain the behaviour of the cell. Mass transfer, diffusion, ion distribution, and electrode theory implement time-dependent differential equations, which require high computing performance, so order-reduced methodologies and parameter model identification are considered challenging tasks to accomplish during this model implementation [5]. Mathematical models have been classified into two main categories: stochastic and empirical [6]. Empirical models describe the specific behaviour of the system using mathematical equations with certain boundary conditions and initial parameters that accomplish real-time parameter identification; however, these models have the disadvantage of achieving errors in the range of 5%????????20% [5]. Stochastic models, on the other hand, provide accurate performance and fast speed that are based on the discrete-time Markov chain. Nonetheless, a hybrid methodology is required to apply parameter identification, which in some cases increases the complexity of the model [5]. Electrical models are based on equivalent circuit analysis that recreates the operating system of the batteries; it is fundamental to point out that this category of models is faster than electrochemical models but has the drawback of neglecting high parameters in detail, such as dynamic behaviour [6]. The increasing development of EVs provides the way for new technologies that complement the application of battery models to monitor not only the physical system but also the operation process in real time; therefore, the innovative and promising DT is emerging to strengthen both sustainability and Internet of Things (IoT) fields. Since the year 2003, the concept of DT has been evolving and experiencing several definitions in the literature review, which consistently creates a lack of consistency and dilutes the concept not only for the research sector but also for industrial applications. In 2020, Jones et al. published a research paper that explains and illustrates the concept of DT [7], which is mainly defined by the CIRP Encyclopaedia of Production Engineering as follows [8]: A DT is a digital representation of an active unique product (real device, object, machine, service, or intangible asset) or unique product-service system (a system consisting of a product and a related service) that comprises its selected characteristics, prope",Overview of battery energy storage systems readiness for digital twin of electric vehicles,IET smart grid,Rolando Gilbert Zequera|Anton Rassõlkin|Toomas Vaimann|Ants Kallaste,https://doi.org/10.1049/stg2.12101

Energy management is one of the effective methods to increase the durability of power sources and the overall economy of the vehicle. The majority of existing studies focus only on fuel consumption. Therefore, an online applicable cost minimization strategy cooperating fuel cell and battery degradation is proposed to decrease the overall operating cost including hydrogen consumption cost and lifetime costs of fuel cell and battery. Two kinds of degradation models are both designed for fuel cell and battery respectively. Empirical degradation model and prognostic model are used to calculate the degradation cost and estimate the degradation performances of power sources along with aging. Creatively cooperating two kinds of models to precisely quantify the degradation rates of power sources under real automobile operating conditions is firstly studied. Validation under a typical driving cycle shows the effectiveness of the developed cost minimization strategy in increasing the economy of the vehicle. The effects of degradation and failure states of power sources, driving cycles and price evolution of hydrogen and power sources on the optimal cost results are also analyzed.",Cost Minimization Strategy for Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles Considering Power Sources Degradation,IEEE transactions on vehicular technology,Huan Li|Hicham Chaoui|Hamid Gualous,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2020.3031000

At least three large families of products should be considered: HEVs with ICE onboard, 'pure' electric vehicles powered by batteries recharged from outlets, and fuel cell hydrogen vehicles. The hybrid electric models continue to increase in terms of importance and presence in the market. In the past few years, they were sold in millions of units in the world and are presently relying on a generation of satisfied car drivers ready to ask for drivetrains with an increased electric component.Today, markets have opened their doors to the BEVs but, economic aspects and performance will be keys factors to declare their success. Their success cannot, in fact, prescind from aspects such as the capacity of producing low-cost batteries or recharging time, driving range and reliability. As is obvious, at the heart of their success there are drivers/buyers who, if on the one hand do not want to have polluting cars any longer are on the other hand unwilling to spend more than needed for a car of the same size and poorer performance. All this with some criticality still perceived in a very discriminating way in the choice of a vehicle, which concern recharging times and ranges guaranteed by at full charge. While the battery-powered cars have a sufficient expected range of 150-200. km per charge for urban use, recharging time is a big issue since, indeed, if a low-voltage outlet is used, at least 5-8. h are needed. Two alternative options could be the high-voltage quick charge, but it requires adequate facilities, and the quick change of the entire battery pack in dedicated service stations.In this chapter, a series of car models are presented and described, both those that are already on the market and those that are going to be commercialized shortly. The vehicles are classified taking into account the level of electrification of their drivetrain and all of them are equipped with lithium-ion batteries, the most advanced technology available today. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This work uses a genetic algorithm to find the minimum cost for a set of distributed energy resources, the component sizes and energy management strategy are optimized simultaneously. It was found that the optimal component sizes and optimal energy management strategy have a significant influence on each other, and therefore, simultaneous optimization of the two aspects is suggested for such distributed energy resources. The presented approach yields higher time resolution in the simulation compared to previous work. Hence, the model can capture short term changes in dynamic loads and generation, making the simulated energy-management performance more representative of real conditions. The stochastically varying load from electric vehicle charging is modeled based on probabilistic data from existing charging infrastructure. With the present model, the performance of several energy management strategies can be examined. The simulation results show that using the battery storage for peak shaving minimizes the distributed energy resources overall cost while simultaneously decreasing its dependence on the utility grid. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that local energy generation with photovoltaic arrays, in combination with local energy storage and connection to the utility grid, is a viable option.",Optimization of distributed energy resources for electric vehicle charging and fuel cell vehicle refueling,Applied energy,M.

40941141,https://openalex.org,PV System|Photovoltaic Arrays|Solar Energy,"The production of electricity and hydrogen in a renewable fashion, such as using solar energy, can provide a clean and sustainable energy source for electric-powered vehicles, including fuel-cell and battery-electric vehicles. Our research on generating hydrogen and charging batteries using renewable solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity has led to the development of a simple and convenient new metric called the coupling factor that describes the fraction of the maximum PV power transferred to electrical loads. The keystone of the coupling factor concept is a regression model to calculate the maximum PV voltage, current, and power as a function of the instantaneous incident solar irradiance and the photovoltaic module temperature. The coupling factor can range from zero to one, i.e., no transfer of power from the PV system to the load, to complete transfer of the PV power. We describe the derivation of regression models to compute important PV electrical output variables, such as the open circuit voltage, the short circuit current, the maximum power point voltage, the maximum power point current, and the coupling factor as a function of the fundamental measured variables affecting those quantities. The models are derived for PV modules used in our previous research to power an electrolyzer and charge high-voltage batteries. In addition, we develop models for other modules using PV cell technologies different from those used in our PV system. Some of the calculated quantities are compared to measurements for our PV system. The usefulness of these quantities, and especially the coupling factor, in rating the transfer of PV power to electrolyzer and battery loads, is illustrated. Finally, we discuss how the predicted maximum power point voltage can be used for real-time control and efficiency optimization of a dynamic PV-load system.

A fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV) with the FC/battery hybrid powertrain is used as the study case. The battery plays a key role in current transportation electrification, and the optimal sizing of the battery is critical for both system technical performances and economical revenues, especially in the hybrid design. The optimal battery design should coordinate the static sizing study against the dynamic power distribution for a given system, but few works provided the synergistic consideration of the two parts. In this study, the interaction happens in each sizing point with the optimal power sharing between the battery and the FC, aiming at minimizing the summation of hydrogen consumption, FC degradation, and battery degradation. Under the proposed framework, the power management is developed with deep Q network (DQN) algorithm, considering multiobjectives that minimize hydrogen consumption and suppress system degradation. In the case study, optimal sizing parameters with lowest cost are determined.

Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) may play a key role in mitigating these emissions without facing the same limitations in range and refueling time as battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In this study, we assess the environmental impacts and costs of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system (FCS) for use in light-duty FCVs and integrate these results into a comparative evaluation between FCVs, BEVs, and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). We conduct a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost assessment for the current state of the technology and two future scenarios for technological development. We compile a detailed and consistent inventory for the FCS by systematically disassembling and integrating information found in cost studies. For the vehicle-level comparison, we use models to ensure that vehicle size, performance, and fuel consumption are unbiased between vehicle types and consistent with the scenarios for technological development. Our results show that FCVs can decrease life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 50 % compared to gasoline ICEVs if hydrogen is produced from renewable electricity, thus exhibiting similar emission levels as BEVs that are charged with the same electricity mix. If hydrogen is produced by natural gas reforming, FCVs are found to offer no greenhouse gas reductions, along with higher impacts in several other environmental impact categories. A major contributor to these impacts is the FCS, in particular the platinum in the catalyst and the carbon fiber in the hydrogen tank. The large amount of carbon fiber used in the tank was also the reason why we found that FCVs may not become fully cost competitive with ICEVs or BEVs, even when substantial technological development and mass production of all components is assumed. We conclude that FCVs only lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions than ICEVs if their fuel is sourced from renewable energy, as is the case with BEVs. FCVs are an attractive alternative to ICEVs in terms of vehicle performance criteria such as range and refueling time.

However, the energetic characteristics of the electrochemical devices (fuel cell, battery, and supercapacitor) are time-varying due to the influence of ageing, and different ambient and operating conditions. Any drift in the characteristics of the power sources can lead to the mismanagement of an EMS. According to the literature, ignorance of health adaptation can increase the hydrogen consumption from almost 6.5%???24% depending on the EMS. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a strategy which is aware of the actual state of the components while conducting the power split. Health monitoring techniques are potential candidates to deal with the uncertainties arising from the mentioned factors. In this respect, this paper first puts forward a concise review of the general modeling techniques which are essential for developing precise health monitoring techniques and in turn EMSs. Subsequently, the utilized methods for prognosis, diagnosis, and health state tracking of each of the mentioned power sources in a FCHEV are introduced. Then, a new taxonomy for the classification of the EMSs based on their health-awareness is proposed based on which three categories of prognostic-based, diagnostic-based, and systemic EMSs are formed.

Assessments were carried out for a present day (2021) scenario, and a sensitivity analysis assesses the impact of changing input parameters on FCEV TCO. This identified conditions under which FCEVs become competitive. A future outlook is also carried out examining the impact of time-sensitive parameters on TCO, when net zero targets are to be reached in the UK and EU. Several FCEVs are cost competitive with ICEVs in 2021, but not BEVs, under base case conditions. However, FCEVs do have potential to become competitive with BEVs under specific conditions favouring hydrogen, including the application of purchase grants and a reduced hydrogen price. By 2050, a number of FCEVs running on several hydrogen scenarios show a TCO lower than ICEVs and BEVs using rapid chargers, but for the majority of vehicles considered, BEVs remain the lowest in cost, unless specific FCEV incentives are implemented.

The rationale behind this solution is to use the exothermic absorption and endothermic desorption processes of hydrogen in metal hydrides for heating and cooling the battery pack, respectively, thus ensuring an optimal thermal management control. An experimental investigation is carried out on a prototype in order to proof the concept and preliminary assess its feasibility for actual implementations. The results show that the system is capable to effectively control the temperature variations within the battery pack: for 1C and 1.5C constant-current discharge tests, a desorption of 30%???40% of hydrogen, over the total amount stored into the metal hydride tank of the system, allows the final average temperature of the battery pack to be around 15 ??C lower than the one reached without thermal management. Moreover, it is found that the system is potentially capable of providing a suitable thermal management for more than four hours under realistic driving conditions.

The objective of the strategy is to minimise the cost of ownership of a low-power (15 kW) fuel cell (FC)-battery electric vehicle. Both the fuel consumption cost and power sources degradation costs are combined to represent the total cost of ownership. The simple adaptive rule-based strategy optimises the FC operation during low-traction power operation and switches to battery charge-sustaining operation for high traction power operation. This minimises fuel consumption and increases the lifetimes of the FC and of the battery. The strategy is then compared with the EMS of the 2015 Toyota Mirai, and the challenge vehicle model is modified to capture the learnings from the Mirai. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis for a plug-in FC vehicle is considered in order to improve FC lifetimes and to reduce costs for short drive cycles. 1 Introduction The objective of this paper is to develop an optimised rule-based energy management strategy (EMS) for the fuel cell vehicle (FCV) model shown in Fig. 1 which was provided in the IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (VTS) Motor Vehicles Challenge 2017 [1], while also modifying the model based on the 2015 Toyota Mirai FCV, and considering a plug-in FCV (PFCV) option. This was the first VTS challenge to develop an EMS for an FCV within a limited development time and 48 participants from 14 countries each developed an EMS. The second VTS challenge (2018) required the development of an EMS for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), while the 2019 challenge involves an EMS for a locomotive application. Fig. 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint FCV model configuration for the VTS challenge FCVs are hybrid-electric vehicles (HEV) with a fuel cell (FC) as the primary power source for the traction drive [2, 3]. The FC is a low-voltage source and requires a boost converter at the FC output to increase the dc link voltage at the input to the traction drive, thereby reducing the inverter and motor losses in the traction drive system [4]. The FC is a unidirectional power source and so requires secondary power sources, such as batteries and supercapacitors (SCAPs), to absorb regenerative braking energy [5]. The dynamic response of an FC has, until recently, been regarded as slow which has resulted in these secondary power sources providing power to the traction motor during vehicle acceleration to improve the performance of the vehicle [6-8]. An EMS controls the power-sharing between the primary and secondary power sources in the FCV. The complexity of the EMS and the controllability of each power source depend on the configuration of the power sources in the FCV. The simplest configuration, shown in Fig. 1, uses a battery or a SCAP directly connected to the boost converter output. In this configuration, battery power equates to the difference between the traction power and the FC output power. The EMS can directly control the FC power output while also indirectly controlling the battery power during steady-state operation. If the dynamic power response of the FC is limited, the EMS typically provides the average traction power requirement while minimising hydrogen (H2) fuel consumption by optimising the operating point of the FC [9]. Note that a bidirectional dc????????dc typically interfaces the battery to the dc link in high-power vehicles such as the Toyota Mirai [10]. The price premium associated with new zero-carbon emission vehicles such as an FCV can be a barrier to their adoption by consumers. Research studies show that if a total cost of ownership (COO) approach is applied to these vehicles, then the lower fuel costs [11, 12] or the higher resale values [13] can offset the purchase price premium during the initial years of ownership (typically a three-year period). Life-cycle cost analysis studies [14] are conducted over a longer time period and in these studies, the degradation of a major power source such as the battery or the FC can result in high replacement costs. These replacement costs can negate the lower fuel costs in the initial years of operation. Development of an EMS in an HEV design, using an internal combustion engine (ICE) as the primary power source, tends to focus on minimising fuel consumption but the significance of power-source replacement costs to the real operating costs of these vehicles is rarely mentioned. Given that an FC vehicle has two power sources with degradation rates higher than the ICE of a conventional vehicle, minimising the degradation rates must be a critical operating strategy for this vehicle. This leads to the concept of developing an EMS based on minimising COO costs rather than just minimising fuel consumption. The 2017 challenge scoring was based on the total COO, which comprises of the combined costs associated with H2 fuel consumption, FC degradation, battery degradation as well as a battery recharge cost to restore the battery to 100% state of charge (SOC) at the end of each drive cycle. The EMS can only control the FC output current, IFC, within a range of 0????????400 A, and the regenerative-braking distribution factor, kD within a specified range of 0????????0.5. All the costs in this paper are reported in US dollars ($) as this was the currency required in the challenge. This paper presents an optimised rule-based EMS for the challenge model which outperforms the published strategies for this challenge. The authors provide an overview of EMS development techniques and power source degradation mechanisms. The EMS of the Toyota Mirai is explored based on the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) test report [8]. The challenge vehicle model is modified to match the Mirai FC performance. Finally, a PFCV is considered as a viable option to reduce drive cycle costs and increase the FC lifetime. The paper is organised as follows; EMS development techniques, FC degradation, and battery degradation are reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 details the FCV model provided in the challenge. Section 4 describes the experimental tests and offline-optimisations to develop our EMS. Section 5 presents the Simulink model of the new simple adaptive rule-based EMS. Section 6 examines the 2015 Toyota Mirai and the modifications to the challenge FCV model. Section 7 is a cost-analysis of a PFCV configuration to reduce the total ownership costs for short drive cycles. Section 8 provides some concluding remarks. 2 EMS and power source degradation This section reviews the literature on EMS development in HEV designs and on operating conditions that impact degradation in both FC and batteries. A brief review of other studies on EMS for FCV is also included. 2.1 EMS development techniques The objective of an EMS is to specify the operating levels for each of the power sources in an HEV or FCV to minimise a particular quantity, e.g. the fuel consumption of the vehicle over a given drive cycle. The system optimisation problem is usually specified with numerous system constraints such as the dynamic operational limits of individual system components. The techniques used to solve this problem may be classified as model-based optimisation or rule-based optimisation. Model-based optimisation tends to be computationally complex and requires long computational times. Model-based techniques are difficult to implement for real-time control of power sources as they also require prior knowledge of the complete drive cycle to determine an optimum global solution. The most frequently referenced model-based optimisation techniques are Dynamic Programming (DP), Pontryagins Minimum Principle (PMP), and Equivalent Consumption Minimisation Strategies (ECMS) [15-17]. DP yields an optimised global solution for a cost function provided the time horizon of the problem is fixed and provided that simple mathematical models of the system can be formulated [18]. The optimised solution is found by defining possible system states for each time-period interval within local and global system constraints. Starting at the final system state, the costs associated with transitioning between all possible states in a time interval to all po",Fuel cell vehicle energy management strategy based on the cost of ownership,IET electrical systems in transportation,Kevin Davis|John G.

Qualitative comparisons of technologies and infrastructural requirements, and quantitative comparisons of the lifecycle cost of the powertrain over 100,000 mile are undertaken, accounting for capital and fuel costs. A common vehicle platform is assumed. The 2030 scenario is discussed and compared to a conventional gasoline-fuelled internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrain. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis shows that in 2030 FCEVs could achieve lifecycle cost parity with conventional gasoline vehicles. However, both the BEV and FCHEV have significantly lower lifecycle costs. In the 2030 scenario, powertrain lifecycle costs of FCEVs range from $7360 to $22,580, whereas those for BEVs range from $6460 to $11,420 and FCHEVs, from $4310 to $12,540. All vehicle platforms exhibit significant cost sensitivity to powertrain capital cost. The BEV and FCHEV are relatively insensitive to electricity costs but the FCHEV and FCV are sensitive to hydrogen cost. The BEV and FCHEV are reasonably similar in lifecycle cost and one may offer an advantage over the other depending on driving patterns. A key conclusion is that the best path for future development of FCEVs is the FCHEV.","Comparative analysis of battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell and hybrid vehicles in a future sustainable road transport system",Energy policy,Gregory J.

The most promising alternatives to fossil fuels, currently under serial production, are battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles. This article introduces a concept of plug-in fuel cell electric vehicle which combines the advantages of the two, optimized for use in the Czech Republic. The assessment is driven by the criteria of powertrain component dimensioning, non-exhaust emissions and operational economy. The total weight of the powertrain and the derived emission footprint of the concept vehicle is calculated based on state-of-the-art battery, fuel cell and hydrogen storage technologies. The concept is then compared to other alternative powertrains in terms of the operational economy, based on energy and fuel costs in the Czech Republic in May 2023. We demonstrate that the plug-in fuel cell electric vehicle can cover the overwhelming majority of driving routes of Czech drivers using the highly efficient battery electric propulsion, while the rest can be serviced using the fast-refuelling fuel cell electric powertrain. In addition, the concept vehicle can be significantly lighter than an equivalent battery electric vehicle, which leads to a considerable reduction of non-exhaust emissions. As far as the operational economy is concerned, we determine that the operating costs of the concept vehicle are equal to those of the battery electric vehicle for shorter routes and lower than those of the fuel cell vehicle for longer routes. We therefore conclude that the plug-in fuel cell electric vehicle can be a viable alternative to the current clean transport technologies as it combines the benefits of the two most popular fossil-free alternative transport powertrains in the Czech Republic while striking a good balance between energy efficiency, non-exhaust emission reduction, driver convenience and operating costs.",Plug-in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Concept in Relation to Driving Practices in the Czech Republic,Transactions on Transport Sciences,Vojtěch Přikryl|Bronislav Vahalík|Adam Poul,https://doi.org/10.5507/tots.2023.024

Indeed, the high cost of battery energy storage, the limited EV autonomy and battery lifespan, the battery charging time, the deployment cost of a fast charging infrastructure, and the significant impact on the power grid are the origin of several research projects focused on advanced power electronics topologies and the optimization of the EV charging stations in terms of power transfer and geographical location. Three charging levels can be distinguished, which differ in terms of output power and charging time. The higher the level of charging, the faster the charging process, as more power is delivered to the vehicle at the expense of power quality issues and disturbances. Moreover, three types of charging systems can be distinguished, which are inductive recharging (contactless power transfer), conductive charging systems, and battery swapping.

In this paper, the energymanagement control problem for a series plug-in PEMFC/Li-ion battery hybrid midsize sedan is formulated and investigated using a two-stage controller (TSC). The control objective is to minimize hydrogen consumption and simultaneously protect PEMFC health. The proposed TSC consists of two controllers designed in two stages with different control functions. During the first design stage, a predictive controller is developed using the telemetry equivalent consumption minimization strategy (T-ECMS) approach to predict the global battery state-of-charge (SOC) optimality trend and local control reference, without regard for the PEMFC health constraints. During the second stage of design, a tracking controller is designed to track the local control reference with respect to the PEMFC health constraints and other physical limitations at the current control step, which ensures that the system follows the optimal battery SOC reference over a long time horizon. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed TSC is compared with the T-ECMS and an electric vehicle controller (EVC) under the Matlab/Simulink software environment. The results demonstrate that the TSC achieves a reasonable tradeoff between hydrogen fuel consumption and PEMFC health protection. ?? 2011 IEEE.",Two-Stage Energy Management Control of Fuel Cell Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Considering Fuel Cell Longevity,IEEE transactions on vehicular technology,Bo Geng|James K.

The cost comprises hydrogen consumption, battery electricity consumption, and the degradation of fuel cell and battery systems. The first strategy is a rule-based approach that controls fuel cell power at several fixed levels, with the battery state-of-charge serving as the shifting condition between these levels. The second strategy is an optimization-based approach that determines the fuel cell power by minimizing the instantaneous running cost. Two coefficients, dependent on the battery state-of-charge, are employed to adjust the cost weights of hydrogen consumption, battery electricity consumption, and fuel cell system degradation. The third strategy combines rules with optimization, incorporating the rules as constraints into the cost optimization model. To account for practical driving conditions throughout the vehicle's lifecycle, short distance driving cycles, long distance driving cycles, and commuter driving cycles are separately investigated. The rule and optimization combined energy management strategy outperforms the others in all driving conditions, benefiting from fewer fuel cell system start-stop cycles and increased opportunities for operating in high-efficiency regions.",Rule and optimization combined real-time energy management strategy for minimizing cost of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles,Energy,Jinglai Wu|Yunqing Zhang|Jiageng Ruan|Zhaowen Liang|Kai Li,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2023.129442

In addition, removing the heat generated in the lithium ion battery cells is necessary for efficient, safe and long-term operation of the hydrogen electric vehicle. In this context, this study introduces an air-cooled battery thermal management system in which the air is taken from the environment, preheated through cooling of batteries and then used in the PEM fuel cell stack. Both the PEM fuel cell and the lithium ion battery systems are analyzed to investigate the compatibility and applicability of the proposed system. Also, the PEM fuel cell electrical power output and energy efficiency are assessed through varying the operating conditions. It is found that, at a current density of 0.4 A/cm2, the energy efficiency of the PEM fuel cell improves from 45% to 48% by preheating the air from 10 ??C to 40 ??C. Furthermore, during discharge of the lithium ion battery, the cooling air removes an average heat generation rate of 3.5 W per unit area of the lithium ion battery to maintain the battery temperature at around 25 ??C.",PEM fuel cell-assisted lithium ion battery electric vehicle integrated with an air-based thermal management system,International journal of hydrogen energy,Aida Farsi|Marc A.

This paper discusses the problem of abandoned batteries caused by the limited life of a large number of batteries with the prosperity of new energy vehicle industry. This paper lists and analyzes the different characteristics of batteries commonly used by three new energy vehicles in the market :(1) lead-acid batteries will not leak in the use process due to tight sealing, but their use cycle is very short. (2) The production of nickel metal hydride battery is relatively mature, its production cost is low, and compared with lithium electronic battery is safer. (3) Lithium-ion batteries are made of non-toxic materials, which makes them known as ???????green batteries???????. However, they are expensive to make and have poor compatibility with other batteries. Because discarded batteries pose a threat to human health and environmental sustainability, lithium-ion batteries may overheat and fire when exposed to high temperatures or when penetrated, releasing carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide that can be very harmful to human health. In addition, waste batteries will also cause water pollution and inhibit the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms and other potential dangers. Therefore, it is necessary to recycle it efficiently. This paper then introduces the advantages of three recycling methods: step utilization and recovery, ultrasonic recovery and sodium ion battery. These recycling methods can maximize the reuse efficiency of waste batteries. This paper expects to find a better way to recycle waste batteries to solve the potential problems of improper disposal of waste batteries and reduce the environmental hazards of waste batteries.",The Hazards of Electric Car Batteries and Their Recycling,IOP conference series.

It can really make our life easier and more economical if used with the same performance as that in recently used vehicles. This paper presents a techno-economic optimization model to perform the optimal sizing of fuel cell/battery hybrid electric vehicles. Optimum sizing has been applied to an electric vehicle consisting of a permanent magnetic synchronous machine, a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell, and lead acid battery storage. The optimal cost design and the new suitable power management approach are the main objectives. The optimal sizing of the proton-exchange membrane fuel cell/battery hybrid power for the vehicle is assessed on the basis of minimizing the cost of supplying energy from the two sources. An improved energy management algorithm is employed to decide the operating modes of the electric vehicles using the instantaneous values of the vehicle power, the pressure of the hydrogen tank, and the state of charge of the battery. The speed control of the system is accomplished by an proportional integral controller and also evaluates its efficiency. The obtained results are verified by carrying out MATLAB simulation using the New European Driving Cycle showing all the seven operating modes of the management algorithm. The simulation studies are conducted to verify the performance of the system under different conditions (acceleration and braking).

To ensure load requirements and minimize the total costs of ownership (TCO) of these fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), manufacturers have to determine power sources sizing and design the energy distribution strategy between the sources. The energy management strategy (EMS) controls this distribution and can be used to reduce hydrogen consumption and sources degradation, which are strongly related to the sources size. The power sources' sizing has a significant influence on the investment costs (CAPEX), while the EMS has a direct impact on the operating costs (OPEX). This paper presents a simulation study to determine the influence of the EMS during the sizing process.

The energy management problem of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles is the key technology for power distribution. The traditional power following strategy has the advantage of a real-time operation, but the power correction is usually based only on the state of charge of a lithium battery, which causes the operating point of the fuel cell to be in the region of a low efficiency. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid power-following-fuzzy control strategy, where a fuzzy logic control strategy is used to optimise the correction module based on the power following strategy, which regulates the state of charge while correcting the output power of the fuel cell towards the efficient operating point. The results of the joint simulation with Matlab + Advisor under the Globally Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Cycle Conditions show that the proposed strategy still ensures the advantages of real-time energy management, and for the hydrogen fuel cell, the hydrogen consumption is reduced by 13.5% and 4.1% compared with the power following strategy and the fuzzy logic control strategy, and the average output power variability is reduced by 14.6% and 5.1%, respectively, which is important for improving the economy of the whole vehicle and prolonging the lifetime of fuel cell.",Real-Time Energy Management Strategy of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles Based on Power Following Strategy????????Fuzzy Logic Control Strategy Hybrid Control,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/wevj14110315
40941250,https://openalex.org,Electric Vehicles,"IntroductionInternal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) have experienced continuous development in manufacturing technology, materials science, motor performance, vehicle control, driver comfort and security for more than a century.Such ICEV evolution was accompanied by the creation of a huge network of roads, refuelling stations, service shops and replacement part manufacturers, dealers and vendors.No doubt, these fantastic industrial activities and business have had a central role in shaping the world and, in many aspects, the society as well.Today, the number of ICEV models and applications is astonishing, ranging from small personal transport cars to a hundred passenger buses, to heavy load and goods transportation trucks and heavy work caterpillars.Modern ICE vehicles encompass top comfort, excellent performance and advanced security, for relatively low prices and, needless to say, have become since the beginning the most attractive consumer products.However, despite approximately a century-long industry and academia struggle to improve ICE efficiency, this is, and will continue to be, incredibly low.As illustrated in Fig. 1, solely circa 30% of the energy produced in the ICE combustion reaction is converted into mechanical power.In other words, approximately 70% of the energy liberated by combustion is lost.In fact and worse than that, the wasted energy of thermal motors, as ICEs may be called, is transformed into motor and exhaust gases heat.The exhaust gases are a blend formed mostly of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and, to a lower extent, nitrogen oxides (NO x ), hydrocarbons (C x H y ), carbon monoxide (CO) and soot.Carbon dioxide is known to block the earth's radiation emissions back into the outer space thus promoting global temperature rise -the so-called greenhouse effect.This, climate researchers say, is silently creating other global catastrophic changes, as for example, sea level rise.Air pollution in big cities is another serious problem caused by exhaust gases, which leads to respiratory system diseases, including lung cancer.Disturbing noise level is another issue related to big fleet of ICEVs in big cities.Yet, this brings about another headache for city administrators and authorities: the daily jamming, though this last nuisance might be alleviated only by mass transport systems (i.e., subways and trains).Whether none of the above listed problems ever existed, yet a challenging situation had to be dealt with urgently: the finite amount of fossil fuel available for an ever-increasing world fleet.As petrol wells vanish, this commodity price skyrockets, also motivated by political tension around production areas in Middle East.On the other hand, renewable energy www.intechopen.comElectric Vehicles -The Benefits and Barriers 2 sources, like ethanol produced from sugarcane or maize crops, are an alternative solution being tried in some countries.In Brazil, for instance, sugarcane bio-fuel is an established option, with more than two decades on the road, with ICE automobiles prepared to run interchangeably on gasoline or ethanol automatically.Any driver could choose which fuel type to use at the refuelling station, much based on their prices.There is a criticism over this solution as regards to the demands on food availability and prices, once crop fields are used to produce bio-fuels instead of food.Greenhouse effect gas generation and air pollution problems are still present though to a somewhat lower extent.Fig. 1.ICEs are very inefficient energy converters as compared to electric motors An accurate look at Fig. 1 reveals that electric motors are far superior to ICE and could do an excellent job in propulsion of vehicles, helping to solve the serious climate, air pollution and noise problems created by ICEVs.As a matter of fact, electric vehicles (EVs) were invented in 1834, before ICE vehicles, being manufactured by several companies of the U.S.A, England, and France (Chan, 2007).Fig. 2(a) shows a picture of commercial EV in 1920.Poor performance of their batteries contrasting to fast development of ICE technology, extremely high energy density and power density of gasoline and petrol, and the abundance and low price offer of fossil fuel, all conspired against those days' EVs that rapidly became defunct.Interestingly, more than 150 years later, triggered by the world energy crisis in the 1970s, EVs entered the agendas of world's greatest carmakers, governments' energy and climate policy, and of worldwide non-governmental organizations worried about environmental pollution and greenhouse effect.Today, although their sales are negligible in relation to that of ICEVs, pure EVs and hybrid EVs (HEVs), i.e., those that combine ICE with electrical machines fed by batteries or fuel cells (hydrogen derived electricity), are offered by world's greatest carmakers.The performance of HEVs, from the driver's standpoint, rivals or outdoes that of modern ICEVs.Their energy consumption ranges from circa 10% to 70% lower than that of an equivalent ICE car, depending on their power, battery size, control strategy, etc.For the sake of illustration, until 2008, Toyota Prius, the world's first commercially mass-produced and marketed HEV, sold over 500,000 units on the world's market (Xiang et al., 2008).Fig. 2(b) shows a photograph of a modern 2010 Toyota Prius HEV whose selling price begins at 23,000 USD.The dramatic gain in energy efficiency, besides much lower or zero gas emission and noisefree operation, is due to the much higher efficiency of electric motors and control strategies such as regenerative braking and storage of excess energy from the ICE during coasting.www.intechopen.com",A Survey on Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technology,InTech eBooks,Samuel E. de Lucena,https://doi.org/10.5772/18046

Normally, the LiFePO4 battery is the main power of the electric vehicle with light load. But while the electric vehicle is climbing, the fuel cell stack will be added for more power supply. While the electric vehicle is going down or braking, the regenerated energy can be recharged to the LiFePO4 battery.

First, this paper proposes a REVB model based on the model of capacity fading of lithium battery cells, which could allow a more realistic result for the design. Second, a power management strategy is presented to regulate the energy flow, for protecting the REVB and other system components. Third, multiple objectives are considered in the optimization model, including minimizing loss of power supply, system cost, and a new indicator, namely, potential energy waste.

For this reason, one of the main commitments of the European Commission is its decarbonization by 2035/2040. To achieve this target, during the last decades, different propulsion technologies were developed such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in electric vehicles (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEV). The first two proposals can be considered as bridging technology between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the BEV because they offer at the same time comparable performance as conventional powertrains and improved efficiency. However, both technologies are struggling with the tightening of pollutants and CO2 limits. On the other hand, the BEV can offer zero emissions at the tailpipe, but it suffers from limited range capabilities and the lack of fast-charging infrastructures. Within this context, the fuel cell vehicle (FCV) appears as an interesting opportunity because it offers zero tailpipe emissions and equivalent refuelling time of the ICE. This article evaluates through mathematical simulations the performance of two fuel cell electric buses (FCEBs), which are supposed to work respectively in urban and highway driving conditions. The urban bus is equipped with a single fuel cell (FC) module of 85 kW-Net and an electric motor (EM) of 225 kW. The intercity bus is equipped with two FC modules with a total power of 170 kW-Net and two EMs of 225 kW each. A sensitivity to the battery capacity from 20 kWh to 40 kWh was performed for both FECBs. The power split between the FC module and the high-voltage battery was optimized with the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS). The two FCEBs were tested considering different portfolios of cycles: in the case of the urban bus in Braunschweig and the Standardized On-Road Test Cycles SORT1 and SORT2 were assumed as a reference, while cycles like the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HWFET), European Transient Cycle (ETC), and cruising at 100 km/h were assumed as reference for the intercity. Simulation results highlighted that the increase of battery capacity in the case of the urban bus from 20 kWh to 30 kWh reduces hydrogen (H2) consumption by 11% along the Braunschweig cycle. On the other hand, in the case of the intercity bus, the fuel consumption is less affected by the increase of capacity in the same range. In this case a reduction of 4.7% is estimated for the HWFET cycle, and it is less than 1% in the case of cruising conditions.",Design of Two Fuel Cell Buses for Public Transport According to Two Different Operating Scenarios: Urban and Motorway,SAE International journal of electrified vehicles,Claudio Cubito|A.

The judicious choice of the energy management strategy not only allows for the best distribution of energy between the different sources, but also reduces the system's consumption, increases the life span of the used sources and fulfills the energy demand that affects the autonomy of the electric vehicle (EV). A novel hybrid control strategy based on the interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) technique is proposed while considering the battery State of Charge (SOC) and the hydrogen level operating conditions.

40941273,https://openalex.org,Hydrogen Fuel Cells|Fuel Cell Durability,"City transport needs to be improved to reduce emissions and increase fuel flexibility and economy. Because electric drive trains display advantages of low emissions, renewable refuelling and improved performance compared to combustion vehicles, the benefits of hydrogen and fuel cells as range extenders of battery electric vehicles have become apparent, especially to obtain rapid refuelling times and 500-km range. This paper describes the situation in China where electric bikes have competed successfully with combustion bikes. Unfortunately, this has not proved effective for cars which are too heavy and consequently require increased energy storage capacity over present battery levels. Weight is therefore a primary factor in choosing the drive train. It is demonstrated that hydrogen can provide that energy storage for cars in the 500-kg mass range, augmenting the battery to extend the range from 100 km to 500 km, as demanded in standard gasoline vehicles. A theory of the weight influence in cars is presented and verified by experiments on the Microcab city car. A hydrogen fuel cell battery hybrid composite car of 7-kN weight has now been tested to give results better than all existing hydrogen cars in terms of low energy use. The new theory fitting these results shows how the sum of many car component losses as a function of weight resolves into a Coulomb curve. The conclusion is that Coulomb's Law can be used to predict city car energy demand quantitatively. Vehicle weight is therefore the major variable in city transport but hydrogen fuel cell drive can halve the energy requirement at a given mass compared to combustion cars.

The work starts by weight minimizing a fuel cell taking into consideration its physical and electrochemical characteristics. Batteries and ultracapacitors are then sized according to their dynamic response features and considering specifications from commercial candidate cells, to propose an electric configuration and specify the baseline for a hybrid power plant. In order to illustrate the methodology, a crossover utility electric vehicle and a WLTC class I drive cycle are used.

Available battery capacity will have to increase by several hundred fold for even light duty vehicles (LDVs), which account for less than half of the global transport energy demand, to be run on electricity alone. However the greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) would be worse than that of conventional vehicles if electricity generation and the energy used for battery production are not sufficiently decarbonized. If coal continues to be a part of the energy mix, as it will in China and India, and if power generation is near urban centers, even local urban air quality in terms of particulates, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide would get worse. The human toxicity impacts associated with the mining of metals needed for batteries are very serious and will have to be addressed. Large prior investments in charging infrastructure and electricity generation will be needed for widespread forced adoption of BEVs to occur. There will be additional costs in the short term associated with various subsidies required to promote such a change and in the longer term, the loss of revenue from fuel taxes which contribute significantly to public finances in most countries. ICEs will continue to power transport, particularly commercial transport, to a large extent for decades to come and will continue to improve. There will also be a role for low-carbon and other alternative fuels where they make sense. However such alternatives also start from a low base and face constraints on rapid and unlimited growth so that they are unlikely to make up much more than 10% of the total transport energy demand by 2040. As the energy system is decarbonized and battery technology improves there will be an increasing role for BEVs and hydrogen which could replace liquid hydrocarbons in transport and the required infrastructure will evolve.

Currently, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are considered as suitable replacements for diesel fleets. However, these technologies continue to face techno-economic barriers, creating uncertainty for fleet operators wanting to transition away from diesel-powered internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This paper assesses the performance and cost competitiveness of BEV and FCEV powertrain solutions in the hard-to-abate HGV sector. The study evaluates the impact of battery degradation and a carbon tax on the cost of owning the vehicles. An integrated total cost of ownership (TCO) model, which includes these factors for the first time, is developed to study a large retailer's HGV fleet operating in the UK. The modelling framework compares the capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) of alternative technologies against ICEVs. The TCO of BEVs and FCEVs are 11%????????33% and 37%????????78% higher than ICEVs; respectively. Despite these differences, by adopting a longer lifetime for the vehicle it can effectively narrow the cost gap. Alternatively, cost parity with ICEVs could be achieved if BEV battery cost reduces by 56% or if FCEV fuel cell cost reduces by 60%. Besides, the pivot point for hydrogen price is determined at ????2.5 per kg. The findings suggest that BEV is closer to market as its TCO value is becoming competitive, whereas FCEV provides a more viable solution than BEV for long-haul applications due to shorter refuelling time and lower load capacity penalties. Furthermore, degradation of performance in lithium-ion batteries is found to have a minor impact on TCO if battery replacement is not required. However, critical component replacement and warranty can influence commercial viability.

Model results are presented examining the utility of placing a hydrogen PEM fuel cell on-board a Miles Electric ZX40ST work truck NEV as an 'after-market add-on' range extender to the existing battery electric drive train, thereby creating a NEVx. Through the development and use of the Sandia-Miles-Altergy Range Test (SMART) model, we have examined the potential for a number of PEM fuel cell stack systems (with varying output power), combined with various hydrogen storage and electrical storage system configurations to achieve the desired range extension for a single 8-h work shift. Furthermore, we have evaluated the 'well-to-wheels' (WTW) and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, and assessed the costs (both capital and O&M) for the different NEVx configurations and operating profiles. This analysis demonstrates that a NEVx incorporating a PEM fuel cell range extender provides a viable means of providing the desired range (or equivalently the runtime) while increasing the vehicle's versatility and maintaining its zero-emissions rating. A 5 kW fuel cell system with 2.6 kg of hydrogen stored at 2265 psi in conventional steel cylinders can meet the demands of the low-power duty cycles envisioned for the NEVx. A slightly higher powered NEVx with a 7.5 kW fuel cell offers the same advantages in operating profiles that require more power, for example with frequent starts, sustained higher speeds, or hilly routes. While currently expensive, the total cost per mile of the fuel cell range extender is comparable to conventional gasoline vehicles. The WTW GHG emissions of the NEVx are 40%-85% lower than those for a comparable gasoline powered vehicle, depending on the particular drive profile and sources of both hydrogen and electricity. The analysis shows that a fuel cell range extender can maintain the vehicle battery pack at a high state of charge (SOC) throughout the operating profile, thereby extending overall battery life and reducing charging time. The fuel cell range extender is currently envisioned as a drop-in retrofit for the existing Miles Electric ZX40ST work truck. However, with sufficient demand, a fully integrated new vehicle system could be both more efficient and less expensive. If designed into the NEVx from the start, the cost, weight, and emissions could all be reduced while increasing the payload space and versatility. ?? 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

A drawback of storing electric energy in a battery is the comparable low energy density, low driving range and the higher propensity to deplete the energy storage before reaching the destination, especially at low ambient temperatures. When the battery is depleted, stranded vehicles can either be towed or recharged with a mobile recharging station. Several technologies of mobile recharging stations already exist, however, most of them use fossil fuels to recharge battery electric vehicles. The proposed novel zero emission solution for mobile charging is a combined high voltage battery and hydrogen fuel cell charging station. Due to the thermal characteristics of the fuel cell and high voltage battery (which allow only comparable low coolant temperatures), the thermal design for this specific application (available heat exchanger area, zero vehicle speed, air flow direction) becomes challenging and is addressed in this work. Experimental methods were used to obtain reliable thermal and electric power measurement data of a 30 kW fuel cell system, which is used in the Mobile Hydrogen Powersupply. Subsequently, simulation methods were applied for the thermal design and optimisation of the coolant circuits and heat exchangers.

In this article, a road, health, and price-conscious optimal cost minimization strategy based on a decision-making framework was developed to decrease their overall cost. First, an online applicable cost minimization strategy was developed to minimize the overall operating costs of the vehicles, including the hydrogen cost and degradation costs of the fuel cell and battery. Second, a decision-making framework composed of the driving pattern recognition-enabled, prognostics-enabled, and price prediction-enabled decision makings, for the first time, was built to recognize the driving pattern, estimate the health states of power sources, and project future prices of hydrogen and power sources. Based on these estimations, optimal equivalent cost factors were updated to reach the optimal results on the overall cost and charge sustaining of a battery. The effects of driving cycles, degradation states, and pricing scenarios were analyzed.",Optimal Cost Minimization Strategy for Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles Based on Decision-Making Framework,IEEE transactions on industrial informatics,Huan Li|Yang Zhou|Hamid Gualous|Hicham Chaoui|Loïc Boulon,https://doi.org/10.1109/tii.2020.3003554

In this paper, a vehicle speed prediction model predictive control (SP-MPC) energy management strategy is developed for the hybrid power system in fuel cell electric vehicles. The main principle of the proposed SP-MPC is that the future vehicle total power demand is forecasted via the Markov speed predictor and imported into the energy management system response prediction model to improve the control performance by more accurate disturbance description. The objective function is set for equivalent hydrogen consumption minimization and fuel cell degradation inhibition. As a contrast, the normal MPC strategy, the speed prediction dynamic programming (SP-DP) strategy and the DP offline strategy are formulated. Comparing with the normal MPC strategy, the SP-MPC strategy has a 3.74% reduction in the total operation cost under MANHATTAN condition. The SP-MPC strategy also has a 1.39% reduction in the total operation cost than the SP-DP strategy. Moreover, two scenarios are introduced with different disturbance prediction accuracy to verify the influences of the prediction inaccuracy on the SP-MPC and SP-DP results. For SP-DP strategy, the total operation cost under actual forecast scenario has increased by 5.03% compared with the perfect forecast scenario. The similar result can be seen in the SP-MPC, but the increase between perfect and actual forecast scenario is only 1.02%, which indicates a better robustness to the disturbance prediction inaccuracy compared with the SP-DP strategy. A DSP hardware in loop (HIL) test is conducted for real-time performance verification of the proposed SP-MPC.",Real-time energy management for fuel cell electric vehicle using speed prediction-based model predictive control considering performance degradation,Applied energy,Shengwei Quan|Yaxiong Wang|Xuelian Xiao|Haibo He|Fuchun Sun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117845

Main contentEV or hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) are mainly used secondary battery in power batteries.Than any other batteries, Ni-MH battery has many advantages: rapid charge or discharge high current, high resistance to charging and discharging capacity, low temperature performance, high mass-power ratio, environmentally friendly (no cadmium mercury or lead) and so on [16].Therefore, this paper studies how to fast and accurately track the SOC based on Ni-MH battery.This paper designs an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting Ni-MH batteries in EVs.For achieving the predictability of the network, the text use some basic characteristics of the ANN algorithm such as the ability of non-linear mapping, adapting to the selflearning, parallel processing method, and so on [16][17].The influence between the current SOCt of Ni-MH battery and the previous SOCt-1 is not considered in most of published paper for the sake of tracking SOC by ANN when they select input variable.So the previous SOCt-1 is interpolated into input variable in this paper.That is to say, the input variable of this discourse are: battery discharging current I, battery terminal voltage U, and previous SOCt-1.Through training a lot of samples, ANN can study and adapt the unknown system's dynamic characteristics, and the characteristic will conserve inside the connected weight of ANN.Simulation results show that the proposed ANN algorithm can accurately predict Ni-MH hybrid vehicle battery SOC, and the average error of output results to reach about 5% in a short time.

The case for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) has been greatly enhanced by significant recent improvements in lithium batteries. New lithium batteries have about three times greater energy density than nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries. BEVs with lithium batteries are similar to hydrogen fuel cell electric cars. In both, the primary energy source may be the same. Energy sources include oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydropower, wind, and direct solar energy. These sources can power both types of vehicles when converted to an energy carrier, which could be electricity or hydrogen. Fuel cell vehicles use hydrogen as well as electricity energy carriers, but in both cases the end point is the same: mechanical energy delivered to the drive wheels. Both vehicles use electric motors and power electronics after the primary energy source passes through an electrochemical step. It is also true for both vehicle types that the possibility of avoiding oil use exists. BEVs with lithium batteries are presently showing well-to-wheel energy efficiencies between 1.5 and 4.0 times better than gasoline powered vehicles or fuel cell vehicles, depending on the primary energy source, and even much more when considering regeneration during braking.",The Case for Battery Electric Vehicles,Elsevier eBooks,Paul Maccready,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-012656881-3/50016-2

In a multi-stack FC hybrid electric vehicle, the power sources (FCs and the battery pack) have different energetic characteristics and their operation is influenced by the performance drifts caused by degradation. Hence, efficient power distribution for such a multi-source system is a critical issue. This paper proposes a three-layer online EMS for a recreational vehicle composed of three FCs and a battery pack. In the first layer, two online estimators are responsible for constantly updating the characteristics of each FC and the battery to be used by the power distribution algorithm. In the second layer, a rule-based method is developed to improve the calculation speed of the power distribution algorithm by deciding when it should be activated. The last layer performs the power distribution between FCs and battery using a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called Q-learning. The proposed RL-based EMS attempts to meet the requested power while minimizing the costs of hydrogen consumption and degradation of all power sources. To justify the performance of the proposed strategy, a comprehensive benchmark with an offline EMS and two online strategies is performed under two driving cycles. In comparison with the online strategies, the proposed method based on RL reduces the defined trip cost up to 11.5 % and 13.08 % under the Real driving cycle while having a higher cost than the offline strategy by 4.78 %.",Q-learning based energy management strategy for a hybrid multi-stack fuel cell system considering degradation,Energy conversion and management,Razieh Ghaderi|Mohsen Kandidayeni|Loïc Boulon|João P.

Extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) charged by small internal combustion engines become an alternative choice because EREVs have longer range and higher efficiency than battery-based electric vehicles, such as lithium battery-based vehicles. However, most EREVs still utilizes fossil fuel-based internal combustion engines, which still have significant carbon footprint. To compromise this downside, this paper proposes a hydrogen fuel cell extended-range electric vehicle design using liquid ammonia as hydrogen source, and quantify the energy and materials flows for the design. This paper establishes a conceptual model of the entire vehicle taking a truck as an example. A typical configuration is selected to perform energy flow balance calculation.
