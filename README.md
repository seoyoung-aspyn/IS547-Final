# IS547-Final

The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has intensified debates around battery technologies, particularly concerning lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. The original Controversies in Electric Vehicle Batteries dataset, compiled from sources such as OpenAlex and Scopus, was designed to support research on these discussions. However, the dataset suffered from inconsistent terminology, insufficient metadata, placeholder values, and opaque relevance scoring that combined manual screening with Abstrackr. The primary motivation of this project was to curate and enhance this dataset by standardizing metadata, improving data quality, and replacing the original scoring with automated, transparent, and reproducible NLP-based relevance scoring. The goal was to make the dataset more reliable and usable for future research into EV battery technologies and policy debates.
