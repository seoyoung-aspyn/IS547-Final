# IS547-Final

The rapid expansion of the electric vehicle market has intensified debates over battery technologies, particularly between lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. The dataset, "Data on Controversies in Electric Vehicle Batteries," compiles structured and unstructured data from various sources, including news articles and academic literature. However, inconsistencies in terminology, missing data, and incomplete metadata hinder its usability and reproducibility.

The primary goal of this project is to curate and enhance the dataset to improve its quality, accessibility, and documentation. Implementing a structured data curation workflow will ensure that future researchers can efficiently analyze and build upon the dataset. The curation process will focus on resolving standardization issues, refining metadata, conducting data cleaning protocols, and strengthening long-term usability while integrating NLP-based relevance scoring for enhanced document classification.

This dataset comprises three primary files: relevancy_scores.csv, which contains document relevance scores determined using Abstrackr predictions and manual screening; relevant_document_list.csv, which provides a structured list of documents, including metadata fields such as title, abstract, keywords, authors, and DOI; and README.txt, which describes the dataset's structure, methodology, and usage. Despite the inclusion of variables such as manual_screen_score and relevancy, their definitions lack detailed explanations. Additionally, there is no data dictionary specifying how the "relevancy" scores were computed in Abstrackr. Placeholder values in abstracts and titles, along with inconsistencies in keyword usage, further impact the datasetâ€™s reproducibility. Given these limitations, this project will introduce an alternative approach using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to compute relevance scores, replacing Abstrackr and manual screening methods to ensure greater consistency and accuracy.
