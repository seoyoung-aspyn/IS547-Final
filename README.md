# IS547-Final

The rapid expansion of the electric vehicle market has intensified debates over battery technologies, particularly between lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. The dataset, "Data on Controversies in Electric Vehicle Batteries," compiles structured and unstructured data from various sources, including news articles and academic literature. However, inconsistencies in terminology, missing data, and incomplete metadata hinder its usability and reproducibility.

The primary goal of this project is to curate and enhance a dataset on the controversies surrounding electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The dataset faced issues such as missing data, incomplete metadata, and inconsistencies in terminology. The goal is to address these challenges by refining the metadata, implementing data cleaning protocols, and replacing the existing relevance scoring methods (using Abstrackr and manual screening) with NLP-based techniques. By doing so, the dataset will become more accessible, accurate, and useful for future research on EV battery technologies.
